D: What brings you in here today?
P: Yeah, I'm just bringing in my three year old daughter who's really been complaining about having a runny nose and has been sneezing a lot over this past week. I think the symptoms maybe started three or four days ago.
D: Okay, and what symptoms started first?
P: I think the runny nose is what started first and kind of the nasal congestion. She was telling me that she felt that there was pressure or congestion in her nose.
D: Okay, and then when did the sneezing start?
P: Shortly after that. Probably maybe the same day or the next day.
D: Okay, does she have any coughing at all?
P: Yeah, so she did start to cough actually after that. So the cough has been there for the last. For the last maybe two to three days. It's a dry cough.
D: Okay. For the last two to three days. Okay. Is she at all coughing up any green or yellow material or any blood at all?
P: No, nothing like that.
D: Okay, so and are her symptoms constant or do they come and go?
P: They've been pretty constant and they've gotten a little bit worse since they started three or four days ago, I think now. Yeah, her symptoms are at the worst right now. Just not feeling very well.
D: Okay, and has she been in contact with anyone at home or at school, if she's going to school, versus at home for the pandemic right now? But any ill contacts at all?
P: Well, she has been going to school. There haven't been any Covid cases where she goes and they've been cautious, but she is going to school right now.

P: No.
D: Okay. Any other symptoms like fevers, chills, shortness of breath, anything like that?
P: She did feel a bit warm to touch and has looked a bit flushed in her face. Just doesn't look like herself.
D: Does she behave like herself? Like, is she more tired at all, more irritable, anything like that?

D: Okay. Has she lost a sense of taste or smell at all?
P: No, she hasn't said any. Anything like that. Just the nasal congestion.
D: Okay. Does she feel any pressure in. Around her face at all?
P: Yeah, yeah, I think so. She doesn't say. No pain, but does feel like a bit of pressure with the congestion, I think.
D: Mm. Okay. Any issues Devil mentally as she was growing up? Like, did she meet her. All her milestones at an appropriate age?
P: She did, yeah.
D: She.
P: Has met. She was walking at the appropriate times and able to talk and does really well in school and is social with her classmates and peers.
D: So no issues or no complaints at all?
P: No, there hasn't been any concerns. I feel she's been developing normally.
D: Okay. And are her immunizations all up to date?
P: They are, yeah.
D: Okay. And were there any complications at all during your pregnancy with her or after the pregnancy?
P: No, it was a vaginal delivery at 38 weeks, and she was a normal weight. We were able to go home right away with. With no complications. So, yeah, things were good.
D: Okay. And currently, who does she live with?
P: So myself and my husband.
D: Okay. And does anyone smoke in the house?
P: My husband does smoke, but he smokes outside usually. And he smokes, I don't know, maybe a half a pack a day.
D: Okay. And I think that's all. All the questions I have. Do you have any questions or concerns?
P: Nothing else right now.
D: Okay. So, yeah, based on her symptoms, she does seem to have some just cold like symptoms, viral symptoms. And it's been. You said three or four days in total, right?
P: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
D: And so most likely it's just caused by viral infection, like common cold, perhaps. It doesn't have any worrying signs of any systemic things going on right now. So no signs of, like, a bacterial infection that I be concerned about that I would give antibiotics for right now, but definitely if her symptoms get worse at home and if she starts having any kind of shortness of breath, increased coughing with producing more yellow or green material, and if she gets more feverish. So we'll also do a physical exam and take her temperature today as well. But, yeah, some of these things to just look out for. But, yeah, so we'll do the physical examination and go from there.
P: All right.
D: Thank you. You're welcome. Take care.
