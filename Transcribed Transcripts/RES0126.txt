P: The shortness of breath just kind of stays.
D: Okay. Okay. And is there anything that helps with your shortness of breath, like taking a rest or any positions in particular?

D: Okay. And is it worse at all when you lay down?
P: No.
D: No. And do you find yourself ever having to wake up at night gasping for air?
P: No, it hasn't gotten that far. But seeing how bad it's been over the past two months and how fast it's progressing, I won't be surprised if I can't even sleep. It's been quite difficult. I don't even know why waited so long. I should have come in earlier.

D: Yeah. Yeah. But also, even if you try to cut down, some of your symptoms might get better. Like, Even though you're 75, you can definitely have improvement in some of your symptoms that you're having, like the shortness of breath and coughing. So if at all that you. You want to consider cutting down gradually, we can talk about that more as well.
P: Sure.
D: Okay. And do you use any recreational drugs, like marijuana?
P: No.
D: And do you drink?
P: I don't know.
D: Okay. So. Yeah, those were all the questions I have for you. Do you have any questions for me?
P: No, I just. I guess I need to be admitted. Right. Just like those other COPD exacerbations. I'm thinking this is exactly that. And I'll have to stay in the hospital, right. For a couple.
D: Yeah. So we definitely. Before deciding on whether or not you should be admitted, since you said the Ventolin is not working for you, we'll definitely give you some ventilation and perhaps a steroid just to get rid of some of your symptoms right now. And we want to also make sure, since you're having, like, cough as well as shortness of breath, to do a Covid swab on you just in case. I know you've been, like, isolating and everything, but just in case, we'll do that. And we'll get, like a chest X ray on you as well, just to see if there's any kind of pneumonia going on. And then from there, we'll also get your blood work. And then from there we'll see whether or not you will require another admission.
P: Sure.
D: Okay. And there you might. I'm not 100% sure, but you might require home oxygen if, like, we take your vitals and everything and your oxygenation is very low. Have you. Have you been talked about that at all in the past?
P: Yeah, they talked about it last time. I've been trying to avoid it, but if it has to happen, it has to happen.
D: Yeah. And it might just sometimes just, you know, you've had four admissions in the past. It might actually just help you stay at home if you are on oxygen anyways. Yeah, we can talk about that. We'll do, like, a full physical examination and everything and go from there.
P: Sure.
D: I'll be with you shortly.
