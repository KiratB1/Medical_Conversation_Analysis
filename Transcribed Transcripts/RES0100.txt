P: No, I don't think so. Do you think it can be Covid at all?
D: So, Covid does present in a variety of non specific ways, and so it certainly could be on the differential for causing a sore throat and abdominal pain, and as well as a fever. However, it could be caused by other things as well. Currently, your constellation of symptoms with.
P: Enlarged.
D: Lymph nodes in the neck, a sore throat, it sounds like you may have, and an inflamed spleen as well, which could all be signs and symptoms of something called EBV or mono. And it sounds like you might have had an exposure, like your husband or fiance, rather, may have had. This last week with the sore throat. All that being said, today we'll do the mono spot test to check for that, as well as some blood work, and we will do a Covid swab as well, just in case.
P: Okay, that sounds good. Thank you. Thank you.
