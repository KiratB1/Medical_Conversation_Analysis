D: Okay. And. Okay, anybody in the family have a history of musculoskeletal or neurological conditions.
P: So, okay, so my father had, like, arthritis, and I don't remember what kind of arthritis he had, but he had severe arthritis. He also had high blood pressure and diabetes. And on my mother's side, there's some arthritis there as well. And. As well as gout and kidney stones.
D: Okay, so that was everything I wanted to ask on the history. And so next I ask you to have a look at your feet. And are you seeing any swelling, redness, or discoloration?
P: I see some redness and some swelling in that area.
D: Okay. And are you feeling any temperature changes?
P: Yes, the right one is definitely warmer than the left.
D: Okay. And how about any muscle atrophy in the foot or lower leg or any joint malalignment or deformities?
P: So in terms of deformities, like, it just looks swollen. And so there's like a big bump on the right side of my foot, whereas it's completely straight on my left. But other than that, no deformities.
D: Okay. And if you're to palpate or press on areas of your foot or joints of your toes, are you feeling any. Any pains along the top of your foot or in any of your other toes?
P: None of my other toes.
D: Okay. And how about any pains at the ankle?
P: No pain at the ankle.
D: Okay. So the metatarsals are not having any pain, and the joints of the second to fifth digits are pain free along with the ankle as well. And when it comes to range of motion, are you able to flex your toes downwards and extend them upwards towards your nose?
P: Yes, I can do that.
D: Okay. And how about your ankle? Are you able to move your ankle in a full range of motion?
P: I can.
D: Okay. And are you having limping with walking or otherwise called an antalgic gait?
P: Somewhat, because I'm trying not to put too much weight on my right big toe.
D: Okay. All right. And so I think that was everything that I wanted to ask and check today. So did you have any other questions or anything that I maybe forgot to ask about you wanted to mention today?
P: No, just what can I do for my foot? How do I make the swelling go down?
D: Yeah, for sure. So right now with having a red, warm and swollen joint that's extremely tender and has limited range of motion, it's important to rule out aseptic arthritis. However, based on several of the risk factors such as diabetes and obesity, as well as your family history of arthritis and gout, thinking the most likely thing is that this is a gout flare and in particular in the toe like that. It could be called podegra. And so we'll need to get a aspiration of the joint fluid just to send it off and make sure that it's not an infection and that we're treating the right thing. If this is gout and it comes back that this way, it's treated with that high doses of anti inflammatories. And we'll start with medication called colchicine to help with this flare. And in the meantime, important things for preventing this in the future are diet and kind of lifestyle related with reducing things like red meats, alcohol, weight loss, and just trying to improve the diabetes management as well.
P: Okay, that sounds great. Thank you.
D: All right, thank you. We'll get that started.
