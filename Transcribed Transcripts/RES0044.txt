D: What brings you in?
P: I just. I have. I have a cough that I've had for a couple of days. And, like, normally if I had a cough or a cold, I would just, like, stay home and rest, but just because, you know, Covid, I wanted to make sure, like, I wanted to get checked out.
D: Yeah, of course. That was a great idea. Thanks for coming in. How long have you had this cough for?
P: It's like, two days, maybe three days ago, I started to feel like my throat was dry, and I was like, oh, maybe I need to drink more water or something. And then the next day, I started actually coughing.
D: Okay. Is it a dry cough or a wet cough?
P: Yeah, it's really dry.
D: Really dry. Okay. So no sputum, no blood that you're bringing up.
P: It's just kind of annoying.
D: Mm. Yeah. Do you have any wheeziness associated with your coughing?
P: I don't think so, no.
D: Okay. No shortness of breath?
P: No. No. I've been. I feel like I've been tired, but I don't think it's been actually hard to breathe. I just feel overall, like, really tired.
D: Okay. Okay. And have you tried anything for the cough, like, over the counter cough syrup or anything like that?
P: Like, I had. I've just been drinking tea, and just, like, tea with honey just to, like, make it feel better. I didn't, like, take any medicine.
D: Okay. And do you. Have you noticed that there are any triggers for your cough, like the cold or dust or any, like, environmental triggers?
P: I mean, I've been. Just because of COVID and stuff, I've been staying home ever since I had it. I can't think of anything, but I don't think so.
D: Okay. And do you find that it's constantly there, or is it worse during a particular time of day, like, morning, afternoon, or evening?
P: It's kind of just been there all the time right now.
D: Okay. And is it getting worse, do you think?
P: I think so. I think, like, today is worse than yesterday and the day before that. It just felt, like, dry, and then. And then, like, the next day I started coughing, so. Yeah.
D: Okay. And have you ever experienced anything like this in the past?
P: I mean, I've had coughs before. This one feels, like, particularly dry, but, like, it. It's not too different than, like, when I've just, like, caught, like, had a cough in other years.
D: Okay. Okay. And you mentioned that your throat was also dry. Do you have a sore throat?
P: Maybe a little bit this morning? Yeah. Like, at first it just felt dry. Like, I was thinking, like, oh, I need to take a sip of water or something. And now it just feels. Now it's starting to sink. I feel a little bit sore, I think.
D: Okay. Is it hard for you to swallow foods or fluids?
P: Oh, sorry, could you repeat that? I just missed the last part.
D: Oh, no worries. Is it hard for you to swallow food or fluids?
P: No, it's not hard. It's not hard to swallow things.
D: Okay. And then have you had a runny nose or a stuffy nose?
P: No, not particularly.
D: No. Okay. How about any changes to your hearing or vision?
P: No.
D: No. How about changes in smell or taste?
P: No. That's like a Covid thing, right? Like, I was hoping, because I could still, like, take my coffee this morning. I was hoping that that means I don't have Covid, but.
D: Yeah, I don't really know. I mean, yeah, some people have it, some people don't. I guess people with COVID present in different ways. Yeah. Do you have a fever at all?
P: Like, when I came in here, when the nurse took my temperature, she said I had, like. She said I had a fever. I don't have a thermometer at home, but, like, I've been feeling really hot, so I've probably been having it for a couple days.
D: Okay. Okay. We can take. Yeah, we can take your temperature. Sorry, did you say you already took.
P: Your temperature today and the nurse took it? Yeah. I don't know what it was, but the nurse coming in and she said it was a little high. I don't know if it was, like, a fever, but I've been feeling hot, though.
D: Okay. Okay. Yeah. So, yeah, we'll double check to make sure that you either do or don't have a fever. Have you experienced any chills or night sweats over the past few days?
P: No.
D: No. Okay.
P: In general.
D: Okay. How about any weight loss?

D: Okay. Are you otherwise healthy?
P: Like, I have. I have, like, some, like, digestive problems generally. Like, I haven't had any changes to that. Like, they think it might be, like, Crohn's or something, but other than that, no.
D: You said you had digestive problems. Did you say it might be Crohn's?
P: Yeah. Like, I've been seeing my family doctor, and they said they thought it might be, but we don't really know, just, like, in general, I guess they've been calling it ibs.
D: Oh, I see. Okay. Okay.
P: I wish I knew exactly, but they just said. Yeah, they don't really know.
D: Okay.
P: But there haven't been any changes right now.
D: Oh, yeah, I see. Okay. Have you ever had any hospitalizations or surgeries?
P: No.
D: No. Okay. Are you on any medications?

P: No.
D: No. Okay. How about marijuana?
P: No.
D: No. Okay. Any other recreational drugs?
P: No. No.
D: Okay. How about alcohol?
P: Like, I drink alcohol. I don't know, maybe I'll drink, like, a bottle of wine on, like, a weekend. Like, over a whole weekend or something. So, like, I don't know, maybe like a. Like, three or four drinks over the weekend.
D: Three or four drinks a weekend? Okay.
P: Yeah, something like that.
D: Sure. Okay.
P: And I'm not at all, like.
D: Okay. So occasionally.
P: Yeah.
D: Okay. And where do you live?
P: I live in town here.
D: Okay. Do you live in a house? In an apartment?
P: My fiance and I live in a townhouse.
D: In a townhouse. Okay. Any concerns for, like, old carpets or mold or asbestos, anything like that?
P: No. No, it's like a new. A new build.
D: Okay. Okay. And do you think you may have been in contact with anyone who's been sick recently?
P: Well, so I work in, like, I work in an office that's attached to a factory, and I feel like I have to actually be there. I haven't been able to work from home, and there was someone else in my office that I think was coughing in that, like, last week, and I. I don't know. I questioned it, but I. I didn't actually get to talk to them and ask them or, like, I don't know if they were actually sick or something, so I might have been. And we wear masks and everything. Like, we're really good. But I don't know. I feel like the offices aren't, like, super. Like, the airflow is not that great. Yeah, that's another reason I was concerned is that I feel like some people might have been sick and I didn't really know the whole story.
D: Right. Okay, so potentially from work, from the workplace, then. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Have you traveled anywhere recently?
P: No.
D: No. Okay, well, those were all the questions that I had for you today. Was there anything that I missed that you wanted to discuss today?
P: Not that I can think of, no.
D: Okay. So right now, it seems like if I'm going through my differential diagnosis list for you, at the top is the thing that we have to rule out is Covid. So we'll take a swab and. And send it off for those PCR results, and you'll hear back either tomorrow or the day after about the results. But in the meantime, and I guess even if the test is negative and you're still having symptoms, please do isolate for 14 days. And if your symptoms get worse, like, you know, you're having trouble breathing, your fever, your temperature is off the charts, or you're having any sort of neurological symptom, please do go to the ER and seek out help. If it's not Covid, it could be another viral illness that's going around during this time of year. And usually the treatment for that kind of stuff is supportive. So make sure you're staying well hydrated, you're eating nutritious foods, you're getting good sleep, and if not. And your symptoms, you know, you're having a productive cough, you're really short of breath. We can test you to see if you have some sort of bacterial pneumonia, and those are usually treated with antibiotics. So that's kind of the plan right now. So we'll just start with that Covid swab for now. How does that sound?
P: Yeah, that sounds great. That's really what I like. I don't feel super sick. I just really want to know if I have Covid or not.
D: Yeah, for sure. And I think it's good that you came in.
P: Awesome.
D: All right. Thank you.
P: Okay, thanks.
