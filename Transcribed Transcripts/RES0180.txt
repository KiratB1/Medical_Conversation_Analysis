D: Okay. All right. I think those are all the questions that I had for you. Did you have any questions of your own? For myself.
P: I was just, well, worried about COVID and was just wondering what I should do.
D: Yeah, for sure. So a lot of your symptoms do overlap with those of COVID So we are going to take a swab today and you should hear back in about 24 to 48 hours. But you should isolate for 14 days, and that includes from family members if possible. And basically just keep an eye on your symptoms if they get worse or you're having, like, neurological symptoms, you should seek help from the er, but otherwise, keep yourself hydrated, eat well. If you have a humidifier in the basement, use it. And for your fevers, you can take antipyretics, like Tylenol, and just. It's just a lot of supportive care. How does that sound? And obviously, like, if your symptoms aren't going away after, like, a few weeks, call us back. And it could be something like bacterial, in which case we can give you some antibiotics.
P: Okay? Yeah, that sounds great. Thank you.
D: Yeah, no problem.
