D: What brings you in here today?
P: Hi, Tisha. I've had this cough that's been ongoing and getting worse, and now I've been having this sharp pain in my chest.
D: Okay, and when did the cough first start?
P: So, yeah, the cough started maybe a couple of weeks ago.
D: A couple of weeks ago. Okay. And has it gotten worse since then, or has it stayed about the same?
P: Got worse initially, but it's been about the. Well, actually, yeah, it's been getting worse because now I've. I've started to noticed blood in the sputum that wasn't there at first.
D: Okay, and when did you first notice that?
P: So I first saw some blood.
D: Two days ago.
P: It was a really small amount, so I didn't worry too much. But I brought up blood yesterday and again this morning. It's been just about enough to cover a tissue, so it's not a lot of blood each time, but it's pretty red.
D: Okay, and before that, were you getting any production throughout your coughs for the last few weeks? Like, were you producing any sputum? No. No. Okay, can you just describe your cough currently? Is it more of a wet cough, a dry cough? It.
P: Yeah, I would say it's dry mostly, with the exception of bringing up some of the blood.
D: And is the blood just in, like, sputum that you're bringing up, or are you coughing up blood into the tissue, for example?
P: Your blood is. I'm copying that up into the tissue.
D: Okay, and do you remember two weeks ago, prior to that, were there any factors that might have caused this? Like, for example, did you travel anywhere or see or was in contact with anyone that was sick?
P: No, I haven't traveled anywhere. I have been doing volunteering and things at the homeless shelter here in town. It's been really cold out.
D: Okay, and how long have you been volunteering there?
P: I started this winter, so the last three or four months.
D: Okay, and were you in contact with anyone there that was sick or was having similar symptoms at all?
P: There's certainly some people around that would have a cough or were not feeling very well. And sometimes I would see people who would even have a hospital gown on that came from the hospital. So, yeah, there were definitely some people who weren't feeling well.
D: Okay, and do you know if anyone at the homeless shelter or anywhere else around your surrounding has had tuberculosis?
P: Not that I'm aware of. I haven't heard of that.
D: Okay. Are you having any other symptoms at all besides the coughing and the blood? Like coughing up blood as well?
P: Yeah, I've been starting to get this sharp chest pain as well. I kind of feel it on the left side and in center, I guess, more so.
D: Okay, and your chest pain, when did that start?
P: So this started? Yeah, about a few days ago as well. It's been within the last week.
D: Okay, and would you describe it as. So you said it's kind of a sharp pain, doesn't move around anywhere?
P: No, the pain, I feel it in the same spot each time.
D: Okay, and are you feeling the pain when you're coughing or is it when you're exerting yourself? Like, when you feel the pain and how long does it last?
P: I. Yeah, I will feel it when I cough. I also feel it if I'm. I don't know, maybe moving around as well, like changing positions or things like that. And it hurts for a few minutes, and then it. It will kind of settle down if I'm. If I stay stationary and sort of lean forward a little bit, it will start to feel better.
D: Start to feel better. Okay. And besides, like, leaning forward, has anything helped reduce that pain at all?
P: Yeah, if I lie flat. Sorry, no. Actually, the pain gets worse if I lie flat or if I'm taking a deep breath in. But really the only thing that helps the pain is if I try to lean forward when I'm sitting down.
D: Okay, see? And do you have any pain when breathing in or out?
P: I do, yeah. It gets worse if I'm taking a deep breath in and even more so after I cough. If I'm trying to catch my breath, I'll feel it then, too.
D: Okay. And other than these symptoms, do you have any kind of shortness of breath? Do you have any dizziness or increased sweating, Any of those symptoms?
P: I have been sweating at night, but yeah, that's it.
D: And how about any fevers or chills?
P: I have felt a bit hot. That's more so. Yeah, maybe when I've been having night sweats, but I feel okay now.
D: Okay, and when you say night sweats, are your sheets and blankets, like, soaked, your pillows?
P: Yeah, they have been a few nights for sure. It doesn't happen every night, but over these last several months, it's been weird. I've woken up soaked.
D: Okay. Do you have any other symptoms, like a headache or nausea, vomiting? No. Have you measured a temperature at all?
P: Um, no, I haven't.

P: No. Sleep's been okay, and I've been eating well, but I have lost some weight and I've been more fatigued over the last couple months.
D: Okay. Before the two weeks or a couple of weeks that you had this, were you sick at all recently, like, with a cold or any flu like, symptoms?
P: No, I guess I've been fatigued over the last couple of months, but I haven't had any flu like symptoms.

P: Yeah, my husband's had a cough as well. He hasn't brought up any blood or anything though. But my daughters have felt okay.
D: Okay, and do you have any past medical diagnosis, like high blood pressure, diabetes, asthma, anything like that?
P: Yeah, I do have type 2 diabetes as well as high blood pressure, and I've been diagnosed with depression before as well, so I do take a few medications for diabetes and blood pressure. I'm not on insulin, though.

P: No.
D: Okay. Do you have any family history of any lung conditions, heart conditions, any cancers?
P: My dad had a stroke when he was in his late 60s, but that's the only thing I can think of.
D: Okay, and I know you said you volunteer at the homeless shelter, but do you do anything else for work at all?
P: Yeah, I've been doing some administrative work from. From home because of COVID So with the extra time, I've been trying to.
D: To do some extra volunteering. That's really good. And so besides. So you live with your husband and three kids. Does anyone smoke in the house or do you smoke at All.
P: No, I don't. No one smokes in the house.
D: Okay. Do you take any recreational drugs, like marijuana? No. And how about alcohol?
P: Sometimes I'll have some red wine with dinner, but that's only on, like, Christmas or an occasion.
D: Okay. Yeah. All right. So other than that. Sorry, I think I might have forgotten to ask you a couple questions. So no fainting spells, no shortness of breath, nothing like that?
P: No, I haven't had anything like that. Just stern cough.
D: Okay. And no chest pain on exertion?
P: No, it's the chest pain. Well, I guess if I'm, like, moving around a lot, but it's not. It doesn't come on, like, because of, like, physical activity. I just feel it, like, anytime I'm, like, when I'm breathing in or even just moving my body around in the chair.
D: And any, like, fatigue or increased tiredness?
P: Yeah, I've had some fatigue for sure.
D: Okay. And have you lost any weights recently?
P: Yeah, I have, actually. I'm down £20. I thought that was great. I've. I was £200 just two months ago.
D: And have you been trying to lose weight or that 20 pounds just went away spontaneously?
P: I mean, I guess I've tried to make changes to my diet here and there because of the diabetes, but I don't really think that it would be enough to lose 20 pounds.
D: Okay, I see. Yeah. So do you have any questions? So those are all the questions I have. Do you have any questions or concerns?
P: No, I would just. I guess just concerned about the blood that.
D: In the cough. Yeah. So definitely that's something concerning. We want to make sure there was no. So you work at a homeless shelter where there may be a tuberculosis case, and your symptoms of coughing up blood, as well as losing a significant weight recently, and some of the other symptoms that you described as well, point towards TB as one of the causes. No lung cancer history. Right. In your family?
P: No.
D: Okay, so we definitely want to do testing for tb. We'll do a smear today of your sputum, and we will. Since you have been in contact with your family, we will have to contact public health if the tests come back positive. And it seems that we'll also do some other testing. Sometimes with tuberculosis, you can get something called pericarditis, and some of the symptoms you are having may point to pericarditis as well. So we might have to do an ekg, might have to further do an ultrasound X ray, for example. So first we'll just get the TB test done, and then if it comes back positive, you will need to isolate, be admitted to the hospital as well and be on a course of antibiotics. So I know this is a lot to take in. Do you have any questions or concerns at all?
P: Not right now. So we'll wait until some of the results come back and.
D: Yeah, get started. Yeah, so we'll just do the TB test first. All right. All right. Thank you. Welcome. Take care.
