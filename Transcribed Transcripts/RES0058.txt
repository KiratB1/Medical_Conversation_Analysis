P: I'm doing okay, thank you. How are you?
D: I'm well, thanks. What brings you in today?
P: So usually we go to my favorite pizza spot for lunch, and these last couple of days, I've noticed I just can't taste it.
D: Okay, when you say the past couple of days, do you mean two days, three days, four days?
P: I would say the last two days, yeah. Just yesterday and today.
D: Okay. And how. Okay. It's a loss of taste. So you can't taste anything or you can only taste some things or you're. You're just not getting the full depth of your taste.
P: Yeah, I really noticed it with the pizza, but with, like, other things, too. It's just. Yeah. Really plain. It doesn't really have any flavor with the food that I'm eating.
D: Okay. So it kind of tastes like cardboard.
P: Yeah, kind of. And I think, like. I mean, part of that is that I. Maybe not smelling it as good either, but. Yeah.
D: Okay. Did you have any trauma to the area like the mouth area or the nose area in the past couple of days or days leading up to that?
P: No, not at all?

D: Okay. And do you feel wheezy at all?
P: No. Wheezy?
D: No. Okay, how about shortness of breath.
P: Maybe after coughing? I've had a hard time catching my breath.
D: Okay, sure. Yeah. And how about any fatigue? Do you feel like you're more tired than usual?
P: Yeah, these past few days have definitely felt more tired. Been sleeping a bit more throughout the day and just, I don't know, kind of lazy.

P: Yeah, they are.
D: Okay, how about dizziness or fainting spells?
P: A little bit dizzy when I got out of bed this morning, but we sat back down for a couple of minutes, I felt better.
D: Okay, good, good. Do you think that this morning you were dizzy because you were dehydrated, or is this like a normal thing for you?
P: I mean, I guess I could be dehydrated. I didn't even think of that. But, I mean, since the food didn't taste so great. I don't know, I didn't. Probably didn't eat as much yesterday or the last. Yeah, the last couple of days, maybe. Didn't. Haven't eaten as much, so.

P: Yeah, there was this guy in my class who was sick last week.
D: What kind of symptoms did he have?
P: Yeah, he had. Well, he had a cough. Fever. Yeah, I think he had a cough and a fever and somebody said, I don't know, maybe a sore throat or something like that.
D: Okay. Okay. So, yeah, some symptoms overlap with yours, I guess. Have you traveled anywhere recently?
P: No, I've been at home. We just started back at going in person to school again.
D: Okay. Okay, that's good. And are you otherwise healthy?
P: Yeah, I haven't been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past.
D: Oh, Good. Okay. Do you have any allergies?
P: Allergies to cats, but we don't have any pets at home.
D: Okay. Have you been around cats recently?
P: No.
D: No. Okay. Stay at home and then. Okay, good. Any hospitalizations or surgeries in the past?
P: I did have my appendix taken out like four years ago. Yeah. At the beginning of high school, but that was just a day surgery and everything went well.
D: Okay, good. Any or. Sorry. Are you up to date with all your immunizations?
P: I am, yeah. I have my immunization card here, actually.
D: Okay, good. Any family history of lung conditions or heart conditions that you know of?

D: With like marijuana vape?
P: No, it's like those flavored ones.
D: Oh, okay. Okay. Yeah. How often do you use that?
P: It's like a few times a day.
D: Okay. And is there any tobacco in there or nicotine?
P: I think there might be, but I don't know. I usually just buy the flavored ones.
D: Okay, well, you know, so you should probably look into if it has tobacco or nicotine because neither of those are good for your health. And so we can, you know, have a discussion later on trying to cut down or quitting completely, if you are open to that.
P: Yeah, sure.
D: I'll just. Yeah. But yeah, I'll continue on asking you some other questions. Do you drink alcohol?
P: No.
D: No. Okay. And who do you live with?
P: I live with my mom, my stepdad, and then my younger sister.
D: Okay. Do you guys live in a house?
P: We live in a townhouse.
D: In the city, you said?
P: Yeah, Yeah, I live close. I go to high school not too far from here.
D: Oh, that's nice. Any concerns with the living arrangements in terms of, you know, like, it being an old building, old carpets, mold, anything like that?
P: No, I live in a nice place. It's usually like really clean.
D: Okay, good. Alright, so those are all the questions I had for you. Did you have any questions or any concerns that you wanted to bring up?
P: I guess the only thing that I was concerned about was possibly having Covid.
D: Yeah, you know, that's probably top on my list of things to investigate you for. So I would say, Covid, other viral illnesses that could be going around this time of year that would have a similar presentation. And so we will do a Covid swoop for you. And in the meantime, if you could isolate for 14 days, regardless of whether the swab comes back positive or negative, that would be great. If the swab comes back positive, we will notify Public Health, and they'll try to trace where you could have caught this from. And if it turns out it's not a viral illness, we'll try to work you up for any bacterial infections which can be treated with antibiotics. So that's where we will start. Doesn't sound good.
P: Yeah, that makes sense.
D: Okay, great. Well, have a great day.
P: Thank you.
