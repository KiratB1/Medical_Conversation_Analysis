D: And other than that, do you have any questions or concerns at all?
P: No. What do you think I should do? From. For now?
D: Yeah. So right now, what we're going to do is because you're having the coughing, shortness of breath, and you have a history of COPD and chf, we definitely want to make sure that you're not having what I think you might be having is just an exacerbation of your copd. And especially with the green sputum, it might be, like a bacterial infection that's causing your symptoms to get worse. So we'll do all the appropriate testing. We'll do a chest X ray. We'll get some blood work done as well. We'll give you some Ventolin as well while you're here, and we might give you, like, a steroid medication as well. So we'll do some of those things right now for you, to kind of help you right now, as well as do some of those tests that I mentioned. Depending on what comes back, you might require an admission to the hospital. Just because we want to make sure you don't go home with an exacerbation, especially with the CHF as well. We would need to get that under control because that can get worse with your COPD exacerbation as well. So we need to make sure some of that swelling goes down if we need to adjust your medications while you're here. So, yeah, let's just. I'll get back to you. We'll do some of those testing and then see where to go from there. Is that okay?
P: Yeah, that sounds great. Thank you.
D: You're welcome.
