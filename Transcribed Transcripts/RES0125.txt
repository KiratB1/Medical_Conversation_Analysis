P: Yeah.
D: How much would you say you smoke on an average day?
P: I don't. I've been trying to cut down. So I smoke about three or four cigarettes a week. I used to smoke a lot more before.
D: Oh, that's. Yeah, that's really good. That's really great progress. It's really difficult to quit, but it's great to see that you're trying to quit. So how much would you say you used to smoke?
P: Well, half a pack. Half a pack a day. But then over the past three years, I've been trying to cut it down. I started smoking when I was 20, so it's been 30 years now.
D: Okay, so 30 years. Okay. And are you just. Are you using anything to help you quit smoking or are you doing it without any medications or, like, have you used anything in the past that has worked for you?
P: No, I went to my doc and he said to try on my own first, and if I'm struggling with it, to come back. But I've been doing it very gradually, so it's going well.
D: Okay. No, that's really good. And yeah, if you at all need any resources to help you quit smoking, it's great that you're doing really well. But if you need to talk more about it or need any more resources, we can provide that for you. Other than smoking cigarettes, do you use any recreational drugs, like marijuana at all? No. No. How about alcohol?
P: I just drink on the weekends. Maybe a glass or two of wine.
D: Okay. And. Yeah, so those were kind of all the questions I had for you today. Do you have any questions you can see?
P: No.
D: No, I was.
P: I guess I was just worried about the cough. It's just. I was worried that it could be Covid.
D: Yeah. So definitely right now, any of these symptoms, like Covid can have a lot of different symptoms. So we should definitely make sure that. To check if you have Covid or not. And we'll get a Covid swab test done for you today, and the results will come back in 24 to 48 hours. And in that time, you will need to isolate even in your own home, try to wear a mask around your family members, try to eat separately, and use all those methods. And then after the test comes back, you'll be contacted by public health if it's positive and kind of given more instruction on what to do. And it doesn't necessarily have to be Covid, either. It can be just another virus, like, it can be just your common cold that's been going on. So it does seem that your symptoms have gone better. Oftentimes, a cough can be the last thing to go. It can take up to two weeks or more for the cough to get relieved. But it seems that you're not having any systemic symptoms, like no fevers or anything else right now. So it's. That's pretty good.
P: Great. I'm glad.
D: All right. Yeah. Thank you. You're welcome. Take care.
