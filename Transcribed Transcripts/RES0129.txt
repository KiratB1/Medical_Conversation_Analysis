D: What brings you in?
P: I'm just bringing my son in today because he's had this cough that's been going on for a few days now, and for these past two days, I've noticed that he's just tugging at his ear more as well.
D: Okay, so you said the runny nose started two days ago?
P: Yeah, yeah, he had a cough. Yeah. Cough and runny nose started about. Yeah, two, three days ago.
D: Okay, the runny nose, what color is the discharge?
P: Pretty clear and watery.
D: Okay. And the coughing, is it dry or is it bringing up any phlegm?
P: It's been dry.
D: It's been dry. Okay. And does it sound harsh?
P: Not really, no. I don't know. It sounds kind of like a typical cough.
D: Okay. Has he lost his sense of taste or smell?
P: He's been a bit more irritable and not eating as much, but I'm not sure.
D: Okay. How about changes in his vision or hearing?
P: No.
D: Okay. Any fevers?
P: I don't think so, but we haven't checked. And he's been, as I said, kind of a little bit irritable.
D: Okay. And any weight loss recently?
P: No, he's been gaining weight, actually. Sorry. I think he. Yeah, he has had a fever. The fever? Yeah, the fever started, like, yesterday.
D: Oh, okay. Did you take his temperature?
P: Yeah, my wife just texted me and told me that she checked it and said it was over 38.
D: Oh, okay. Yeah, we'll definitely take a temperature here as well just to make sure. Has he had any rashes? No, no rashes. Okay. And how about shortness of breath or wheezing?
P: No, I haven't heard that.
D: No. Okay. And then have you actually taken a look into his ears?
P: No, I haven't. He's been tugging at the right one.
D: Is he itching it at all?
P: Yeah, I guess. Just kind of like really rubbing it around the outside and pulling on the lobe a little bit.
D: Okay. Any discharge? Oh, sorry. Go ahead.
P: Oh, sorry. I was going to say he's been kind of fussy and pointing at it and no discharge from the ear?
D: No discharge. Okay. Does it look swollen?
P: No, the outside of the ear looks normal.
D: Okay. Okay. And how have his bowel movements been?
P: That's been normal.
D: Normal. Any changes in his urine?
P: No, that's been normal.
D: Nausea or vomiting?
P: Nope.
D: Headaches?
P: No, I don't think so.
D: Okay. How about dizziness or fainting spells? No, no. Any confusion or memory loss?
P: No, I don't think so.
D: No. Okay. Is he an otherwise healthy child?
P: Yeah, he is. I mean, about six months ago, he had croup I think, but he recovered quickly from that and he didn't need to go be hospitalized or anything.
D: Okay. And his mother's pregnancy with him, was it complicated in any way?
P: She had gestational diabetes, but it was diet controlled and she's healthy now from that perspective.
D: Okay. Okay, that's good. And then was he born at term?
P: He was, yeah. He was born over like, 38 weeks, I think.
D: Okay, good. And was it a C section or vaginal delivery?
P: Vaginal.
D: Okay. Any complications during the delivery? No, no. Okay, how about after birth? Was he hospitalized for any reason?
P: No, he wasn't. He was able to go home.
D: Okay, that's good. And has he been developing normally in terms of his motor movements, like, behavior wise, social wise? Like, is he on par with his peers in terms of milestones?
P: Yeah, he is. Yeah. Everything's been normal that way. And he's been growing well, too.
D: Okay, good. Growing well, gaining weight. Well. Okay. Is he on any medications?
P: No, he's not.
D: Okay. Is he up to date with all his immunizations?
P: He is, yeah. We've been following along with that.
D: Okay. Does he have any allergies?
P: I don't think so, no.
D: Okay. Any family history of lung or heart conditions? No, no. Okay. Does anyone at home smoke?
P: I do, but not like in the house or anything like that, usually just. Well, it'll always be either outside or when I'm at work.
D: Okay. Okay. Any old carpet dust, mold, asbestos, anything like that in your home?
P: No, no.
D: Okay. Who does he live with?
P: So, yeah, he lives with me. Just me and my wife.
D: Okay. Any pets at home?
P: We have a dog. Yeah.
D: Okay. Has he been in contact with anyone sick recently?
P: Not that I can think of.
D: Okay. Is he in, like, daycare?
P: No, no. My wife's been. Been looking. Looking after him at home. She's a primary caregiver while I'm at work.
D: Okay. Any travel recently?
P: No.
D: No, no. Okay, well, those were all the questions that I had for you today. Did you have any own.
P: No, Just was wondering what might be going on.
D: Yeah, for sure. So right now it sounds like a viral picture. It sounds like he has a cold and possibly an ear infection. I have to take a look into his ear to be able to tell more, but because some of his symptoms overlap with those of COVID we'll probably do a swab, and you should hear back in about 24 to 48 hours. And so after I take a look into his ears, we can do one of a couple of things. So if his tympanic membrane looks like it's been perforated or if there's pus in there, then we'll prescribe him, like, a 10 day course of antibiotics. And if I see, like, middle ear effusion or his tympanic membranes bulging and he seems really sick, like he has a high fever, which he does, I will again prescribe him 10 days of antibiotics. And if he has middle ear effusion or a bulging tympanic membrane, just one of those two, and he doesn't seem to be too sick. We can reassess him in 24 to 48 hours. And the antibiotic that we usually prescribe is amoxicillin. How does that sound?
P: That sounds really good. Thank you.
D: Okay, no worries. Take care of.
