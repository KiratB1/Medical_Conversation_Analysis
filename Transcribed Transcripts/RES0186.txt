D: Okay. Okay. And have you traveled anywhere recently?
P: No travel, just been going to work and doing the essentials and home.
D: Okay, that's good. And any reasons to believe you have old carpets, mold, asbestos, pets, anything at home that could be making your condition worse?
P: I don't believe so, no. It's a newer home and we've done some renovations.
D: Okay, that's good. Those are all the questions that I had for you today. Did you have any questions of your own? For myself, no.
P: I was just worried that I could have Covid.
D: For sure. So that's kind of top on my list right now to rule out. So we will do a Covid swab, and you should hear back in about 24 to 48 hours with those results. In the meantime, you should isolate for about 14 days. And if your symptoms get worse, go to the er. If you're experiencing things like weakness, seizures, and you're not getting any better in a couple of weeks or you feel dehydrated, otherwise, supportive care at home, keeping yourself hydrated, eating well, sleeping well, all of those will definitely help as well. Does that sound okay?
P: Yeah, it does. Thank you.
D: Okay. Yeah, no problem.
