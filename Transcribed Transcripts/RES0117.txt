D: Any travel outside the Philippines recently?
P: So I think so this year has just been the Philippines before. I used to go to India as well, but recently, nothing outside of the Philippines.
D: Okay. Okay. Those were all the questions that I had for you. Do you have any questions for me?
P: Yeah, I was very worried about the blood. I was just reading some things up and about tuberculosis. So I was really stressed out today.
D: Yeah. So that's definitely high on our differential. So we'll do a couple of things. We'll do a Covid swab on you just to rule that in or out. You should hear back about Those results in 24 to 48 hours while you're here in the hospital. We're also going to do a chest X ray and. Or like an AFB smear to see if you have active TB or latent tb. If those come back positive, we will require you to isolate because this. Because TB is highly infectious and it's airborne. So we have a couple of. We have like, a regimen that would put you on. It's called the ripe medications that we keep you on for two months and then we continue a couple of those for another four months. But we will keep you here until we have more answers on, like, from this TB standpoint. How does that sound?
P: Yeah, that sounds good. Really worried, but hopefully it's not tb.
D: Yeah, hopefully it's not. But if it is, it's okay. Like, we'll get infectious disease involved, we'll get the isolation going and we'll get you on the correct treatment.
P: Okay, thank you so much.
D: Yeah, no problem.
