D: How may I help you?
P: I just came in because I've been having this just. Just yesterday it started this sudden just pain over the front of my kind of like my shoulder and also elbow. And it was right after. I was just doing some workout, and this pain just started, and it's just. Just like a stabbing, sharp pain that hasn't really gone away since then.
D: Okay, and so what activity were you doing specifically?
P: So I was doing. So I was just doing weight training, and I was kind of flexing my elbows and I was working on my biceps. I was on that machine where you. I wasn't using weights or doing curls, but I was working on my biceps. And I think I did hear. I don't think I heard like, any pop or anything, but right after that, I just had this sudden sharp pain in my shoulder as well as my elbow.
D: Okay, so you think you heard a pop at that time?
P: I'm not sure if I heard a pop, actually. I think I might have, though.

D: Sorry, how long is that. How many days has the pain been on, going on for?
P: Just. It just started yesterday.
D: Yesterday. Okay. And since then, has the pain been getting any better or any worse?
P: I think it's the same. I. Probably a bit worse than. So it just happened last evening and I. I didn't end up coming last night, but I wanted to make sure I just come in this morning since it's just been a really painful night.
D: Okay. And have you done anything that's made the pain worse since last night?
P: No, I've tried to just rest and I tried to use some ice. I. But nothing. Nothing's been working. And I kind of also have like this. It's weird. It just like this mass right where my biceps is. It kind of just makes my biceps look really Big.
D: Okay. All right, well, I'll skip look at that during the physical exam component. Thank you. And so, like, are you seeing swelling there as well, or is that part painful?
P: Yeah, it's painful. There's swelling there as well.

D: Okay. And have you had any issues with your shoulder before, like. Like a subacromial, like impingement syndrome or like a rotator cuff pains or problems in the past?
P: A few years ago, I did have some pain with, like, some. They. They told me not to do, like, overhead work. Like, just things that require. Like, with physio, I needed to do some strengthening as well, and it was. It was in the same Same shoulder.

D: Okay. And for the shoulder, in the past, did you have any imaging done, like an ultrasound, or, or MRI maybe to look at the structures?
P: No, it was just. It kind of went away. I just did some physio. They didn't really do any imaging.
D: I see. Okay. And can you tell me a little about your living situation right now, like who you're living with and where?
P: Yeah, so I'm living with my wife and a daughter and I'm living just in a condominium in the city.
D: Okay. And are you working right now?
P: Yeah, so I'm an accountant. I'm working from home, so it's not that bad. But I might just take a few days off if. Depending on what I have to do with this injury.
D: Okay, and do you in hobby wise, you mentioned like weightlifting. Are you an active person, like bodybuilding and that sort of thing regularly?
P: I just actually probably started this past year. I used to. I used to work out a lot, university and in my early 30s. But then I stopped and this year I've kind of gone back into it.
D: Okay, well, it's good that you're staying active. And do you smoke cigarettes?
P: No. I probably tried a couple times in high school and university, but just. It was never my thing.
D: Okay, and how about cannabis? Like smoking marijuana or using any of those types of products?
P: No, I try to stay away from any drugs.
D: Okay. Including recreational drugs?
P: Yep.
D: Okay. And are there any musculoskeletal or neurological problems that, that run in the family?
P: Not that I know of, no.
D: Okay, now how about any autoimmune diseases?
P: No, I don't think so.
D: Okay, so next I just wanted to ask you to have a look at the, at the arm and compare it to the other side. Are you noticing any swelling, redness or. Yeah, any swelling or redness?
P: I do see some just like, kind of like in the middle ish area, some redness. Kind of looks like some bruising in that. In that region. I also feel like when I try to flex my biceps kind of have moved upwards.
D: Okay. Is this the mass or a lump that you were mentioning earlier that you kind of can notice in your right arm?
P: Yeah. Yeah.
D: Okay. Is there any temperature change? Like does it feel warm on that side?
P: No, I can't really tell if it's warm or not.
D: Okay. And you see, you mentioned are you able to bend your elbow all the way up to flex it all the way up, or is the range of motion limited?
P: It's pretty limited. It's pretty tough to flex. It's really painful. And then I also can't, like, I can't turn my arm. I can't supinate.
D: Okay, so. Yeah. Is that. So you have produced supination as well. And how about your shoulder movement? Are you able to, like, if you're lifting your arm straight out in front of you, are you able to. To lift them all the way up above your head.
P: Like at the sides or. In front of me?
D: In front of you?
P: Yeah, the shoulder seems to be okay. I am able to lift up, but it's just if I try to move my upper arms at all, it hurts a lot.
D: Okay. All right. So you'll get some pain at the. At the shoulder with the movement.
P: There is discomfort in the affected side, but I can move it much more than I can move my elbows or anything like that.
D: Okay, I see. So I think that was everything that I wanted to ask about and look for on a physical today. Was there anything I maybe missed or anything like that?
P: No, I think I don't have any other questions.
D: Okay, so based on the history and what you're telling me for the physical as well, of having a history of exercising and also shoulder pain with overhead head movements, which are risk factors for developing a biceps tendon tear or biceps tendon injury, and having the swelling and bruising as well as reduced function of biceps or elbow flexion, it all suggests that there is a biceps tendon tear or injury there. And so we'll want to get an ultrasound or MRI to look at. We'll start with the ultrasound, but then possibly get an MRI as well to look at the extent of the tissue damage. But if there is just a long head of biceps tear, it will usually be treated conservatively. And so we'll just need to look to see what the extent of the injury is.
P: Okay.
