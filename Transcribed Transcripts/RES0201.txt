D: Okay, okay. And when did that start?
P: That started like immediately after my sore throat.
D: Okay. Okay. Okay. Well, we might circle back to that. I think, if any more questions you want to ask right now. But just in general, in terms of your overall health, do you have any chronic conditions that you take medications for or see a doctor for regularly?
P: I have mild copd.

P: I live alone.
D: Okay. And do you smoke?
P: I quit two years ago.

P: I worked for gm.
D: Cool. Okay. And do you have any family history of respiratory problems, heart problems, cancer?
P: No.
D: Okay. Okay. I think that that about covers my questions for you right now. Is there anything else that you wanted to add that I didn't ask you about?
P: No, I don't think so.
D: Okay, well, I am going to go over this with the doctor that I'm working with today. I'm guessing just because some of your symptoms are in line with common symptoms of COVID 19 that will probably get a Covid swab. And what happens with that is since you do have some symptoms you'll have to isolate until the results come back and potentially after that you still have symptoms even if it is negative. So that's just kind of a heads up on that. Maybe one of the next things that happens. We will probably get you a chest X ray because we want to get an idea of what's going on in there. Did you have any other questions?
P: No. Thank you very much.
D: Okay, well, thanks for chatting with me. We should be back shortly to kind of let you know about the next step.
P: Okay, great. Thank you.
D: Thanks.
