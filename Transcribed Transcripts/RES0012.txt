D: What brings you in today?
P: Well, I can't. I can barely breathe for, like, two days now, and I've been coughing and been having, like, a little bit of pain in my chest.
D: Okay, the pain in your chest is. Can you point out or can you describe the pain to me is as sharp as a doll.
P: It's hard to say. I haven't really had this before. It's more like it just kind of hurts just in the middle, and it gets worse, like when I cough and when I. If I take like, a really deep breath, it will hurt. Yeah. Does that make sense?
D: Yeah. So the shortness of breath and the chest pain, they occurred simultaneously, right? On the same day, like two days ago?
P: Yeah. I mean, now that I think of it, I maybe started coughing a little bit earlier than that, but when it got harder to breathe is pretty well around the same time that I started feeling more pain.
D: Okay. All right, so let's focus on the coughing first. Are you coughing up any blood at all?
P: No, I haven't any blood.
D: Okay. And how about sputum?
P: I guess it feels like there's some, like, mucus. I don't know, kind of like spit looking, but maybe like, thicker than that.
D: Okay. Is it yellow?
P: Yeah, yeah. Creamy yellow, yeah.
D: Okay, sure. And are you wheezing with the cough?
P: I don't think so, no.
D: Okay. And is your shortness of breath worse with exertion?
P: I haven't been doing much, really, because I've just been so wiped out, so probably, I guess it's kind of. I'm really, you know, having been getting up very much, and I'm normally really active. Like, I. I train for triathlons, and I. I'm not like a couch potato. Right. And I feel like I've been just kind of sitting down.
D: Okay. Do you have the chest pain at rest as well, or is it just with the coughing?
P: Like, if I take a deep breath, I'll have it, but no, I don't think. Not. Not like right now. Not like, just sitting here.
D: Okay. And the coughing. How often are you coughing?
P: Oh, it kind of varies. I feel like I get up in the night, kind of sweaty, and I'll cough for a while, and it'll keep. Keep me up. And then during the day, it's like I might go, you know, a couple hours without, but then I'll cough and I'll kind of keep going for a few minutes. So it's a lot, like, probably. I probably don't go more than, like, two hours without.
D: Okay. Okay. And how far can you Walk before you start feeling shortness of breath.
P: I mean, I haven't been walking very far. Like, I walked in here from the parking lot, and that was fine, but I'm tired.
D: Okay. Okay. And I just want to ask you some other questions, Jessica. So have you had any fevers recently?
P: I don't actually have a thermometer at home that works, but I. Like I said, when I've been getting up in the night coughing, I've been, like, really hot and sweaty. It's kind of gross.
D: Like.
P: Like, I just. I feel, like, soaked and. But, yeah, I don't have a thermometer.
D: Okay, so these night events that you're describing, are they more chills or night sweats?
P: I don't know. It just feels like when. You know, when you're. I don't know, like when you're a kid and you get really sick and your parent tells you you have a fever. Like, I don't have an actual temperature, but do you feel hot? I feel hot, yeah.
D: Okay. Okay. And have you lost any weight recently?
P: No. I mean, I'd like to, but no.
D: No. Okay. Any changes in your vision?
P: Uh, no.
D: Hearing?
P: No.
D: Smell?
P: No.
D: Any. Do you have, like, a stuffy nose, runny nose?
P: Maybe a little. A little bit. It's been more the coughing that's bothered me, so I haven't thought that much about it.

D: Okay, and then how about your stools? Have they been normal?
P: Yeah.
D: Okay, and then how about your urine? Is that. Has everything been normal from that standpoint?
P: Yeah.

P: They just said because I, like, had diabetes that I should probably start taking it.
D: Okay. Yeah. All right.
P: Like, I think there was, like, a big problem. It was just, you know, my family doctor, my dad has diabetes and he had heart problems. So, like, she also. My family doctor knows my dad, too, so I don't know if that has something to do with it.
D: Okay. Okay. And then, yeah, I guess we'll talk about family history since you brought it up. Any lung issues in the family?
P: Not that I know of.
D: Like, okay, just.
P: I mean, the heart. Like, my dad had a heart attack. I don't know if that counts as, like. Because it's close.
D: How old was he?
P: Wasn't that long ago. He was, like, in his 60s.
D: Okay.
P: Yeah.
D: Okay. I'm gonna name a few things, and you let me know if this is in your history. Okay. In your family history. Asthma.

P: I don't think so.
D: No. Pulmonary fibrosis?
P: No.
D: No. Okay. Okay. And are you up to date with all your immunizations?
P: Like, I always. I always got, like, the ones I was supposed to. I normally. Like, normally where I go into work, there's, like, a pharmacy outside, and I would get my flu shot. But this year, because, like, I'm working from home, I haven't even Been around there, so I didn't get it this year, but, like, I have all the normal ones.
D: Okay. And then do you smoke, Jessica?

P: Oh, like, if I'm, like, with friends, maybe on a weekend.
D: Okay. Okay.
P: A couple drinks or something.
D: Okay. And have you been in contact with anyone who's been sick around you?
P: Like I said, I work from home, so I haven't been seeing very many people. I. Like, I. My sister. I saw my sister, and, like, she. I guess she works. She works in, like, a retirement home.
D: Okay.
P: Like, she. I don't think she was sick.
D: Okay. Okay. Is it possible that she was in contact with someone who may have been sick?
P: I think it's. I mean, it's possible. Like, that's what she does for. For work, right?
D: Yeah.
P: Works in, like, a retirement home, so, yeah, it's possible.
D: Okay. And what. What kind of work do you do, Jessica?
P: I'm an accountant.
D: Okay. And have you traveled anywhere recently? I know with COVID obviously that's hard.
P: But I wish I canceled trip, you know? No, I haven't been anywhere. Like I said, I've just been at home.
D: Okay. In particular, have you been in a country where TB is endemic? And have you been in any of those countries in the past, like, five to 10 years?
P: I don't know. Like, I've been to, like, the States before COVID and. But I didn't really. I haven't traveled anywhere cool. In a long time.
D: Okay. Okay. So just kind of going through what it could be that you have right now. I'm thinking a few things, and I kind of like to go through and make sure we're not missing anything. So in terms of, like, vascular stuff or things, it could be something like a CHF or pulmonary embolism, and that stands for congestive heart failure. But you're very young. You seem like you're very healthy, so that's probably lower on our differential, obviously.
P: Okay.
D: Yeah. Infection would be the biggest one right now with the cough, it seems like you have chills and night sweats. Yeah. So we'd have to do more in terms of taking your temperature and see if you. And do, like, more work of, like, a chest X ray to see what's happening in there. Autoimmune stuff could be, like, sarcoidosis, but unlikely because it seems like this is an acute issue for you.
P: Yeah. Like, I'm See, I never come besides, like, because I, you know, need my insulin. I never even go to the. I didn't even want to come in. It just like, it wasn't going away.
D: Yeah. Yeah. And then other things, like copd, pulmonary fibrosis and like. Like cancerous stuff is super low on the differential right now. Yeah. So. Yeah. So for right now, we'll start. We can start by doing some blood work. First. I do a physical exam, of course, and then from there we would kind of do some blood work to see if your white blood cell count is high. And then we can do a chest X ray to see if there's like a consolidation, if there's pneumonia or, you.
P: Know.
D: Or anything viral. Do you have any questions? Anything that you wanted to add that I missed?
P: I don't think. I don't think so. Yeah. I just hope I can get feeling better. I hope it's not anything serious, like, I think. Yeah, I just hope it's like. I hope, like you said, it's like I got like an infection or something and just be gone soon.
D: Yeah. Yeah, it does sound like it from the timeline. Like you started coughing two days ago. And then the difficulty breathing or shortness of breath also two days ago. And then the chest pain just seems like it's from you coughing a lot.
P: Oh, it can do that.
D: Yeah.
P: Okay.
D: Yeah.
P: Yeah.
D: Okay. So I guess we will see you at our follow up after all of these investigations are done.
