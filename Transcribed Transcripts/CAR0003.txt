D: Okay. All right. Is there any other questions or concerns that you have or something I may have missed to ask you today?
P: No, I don't think so.
D: Okay. So based on what we talked about from your swelling as well as breathlessness while laying down, in your past history of a heart attack and high cholesterol, it may be likely with the medications you're on, as well as your history, that you might be having what's called a congestive heart failure. So we will need to do further investigations to determine if that is what it is and if we need to get you on something like Lasix or a diuretic to get rid of some of the fluid that's building up in your body, which may be caused by heart failure. So we'll do some investigations and then go from there.
