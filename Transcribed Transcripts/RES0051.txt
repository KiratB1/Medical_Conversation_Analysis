D: Okay. And have you had any fevers or chills?
P: I don't know about fevers. I guess I was feeling a little bit hot last night, but I didn't take my temperature.

P: I think my aunt has asthma, but I was. I was checked for asthma when I was younger. I. And it turns out I don't have it.
D: Okay. And any diseases that run in the family, like genetic or congenital?
P: I think Crohn's disease.
D: Okay. And who in the family has that?
P: My father.
D: Okay. And so that was everything that I wanted to ask today. Was there anything you wanted to tell me?
P: No, that's. That's it. What do you think I have?
D: Well, it's sounding like it could be most likely an infectious type of process going on with the possibility of having a fever with a cough and sore throat. So we'll do a physical exam and also some investigations which will include a COVID test today because some of these symptoms do overlap, but it could be something like the common cold, like adeno virus that's bringing this on. So it's not necessarily Covid, but because we're doing the test, it will require 14 days of self isolation. And we'll get back to you with the results as quickly as we can.
P: Okay, sounds great. Thank you.
