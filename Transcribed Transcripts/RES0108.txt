D: Okay.
P: Are they healthy? Yeah, they're all healthy. Any old carpet dust, mold, or asbestos in your home? Not that I'm aware of, no.
D: Okay. Okay.
P: Well, it seems like those are all the questions that I had for you today. Did you have any questions of your own? No, I just want to get tested for Covid.
D: Yeah.
P: So we'll definitely do a Covid swab on you because you have a cough, and those results should come back to you in about 24 to 48 hours, so you'll know more then. But because your symptoms do overlap with that of COVID we still Recommend Isolating for 14 days. But the other thing I want to mention is that you don't have any other symptoms of infection besides your cough. And it seems like the cost started a week ago, and you started this new medication, Ramipril, two weeks ago. So Ramipril is a type of ACE inhibitor, and one of its side effects is that in some people, it can cause coughing. So I am going to review your medications, and if your family doc also agrees, we may try another blood pressure medication for you instead of Ramipril. So we'll try and change that medication and see if your coughing stops. How does that sound? Sounds great.
D: Okay. Great. Thank you.
