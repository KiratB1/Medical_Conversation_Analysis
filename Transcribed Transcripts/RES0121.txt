D: Nothing like that. Okay. Yeah. Those are all the questions I have for you. Do you have any questions or concerns?
P: Yeah, what should I do about this cough?
D: Yeah, so this cough, it's been going on for the last four days since you do have a cough. And right now that is considered a symptom that. Like a potential symptom for Covid. We definitely want to do a Covid swab test for you, which will come back in 24 hours to 48 hours. You should still try and isolate as much as you can away from any roommates or family members for the next, so 14 days since you first experienced the cough. And based on, like, public health will call you as well, so you can follow their instructions. And it can be anything else, too. Like, with a cough, there can be multiple things going on. You can have, like, an upper respiratory, viral or bacterial infection, but since you're not having too many other symptoms right now, it can just be bronchitis. This is something that we'll try and keep an eye on and make sure it's nothing else, like a pneumonia, for example. But right now. Yeah, we'll get that testing done and then just kind of wait and watch.
P: Sure. Yeah. That sounds great. Thank you.
D: You're welcome. Take care.
P: You too.
