D: Okay, so those are all the questions we had. Do you have any questions or concerns?
P: No. What do you think I have, and is there anything I need to do right now?
D: Yeah. So what? Some of your symptoms are concerning, especially the coughing of blood, which is something that we always think of with tuberculosis. You don't have any history of family history of lung cancer or anything like that. So right now, especially since you just moved from India, where tuberculosis is endemic, we need to make sure that we test you for tuberculosis. In the meantime, though, you will need to stay in the hospital and be in an isolated room where we can filter some of the air and make sure it's a very infective condition if you do have it. So while you're getting all the tests done, you will need to stay here in an isolated room. Also, we will get some sputum smears and cultures to test for tb, and we will also, I will need to if the test comes back positive, we will need to contact Public Health and let your contacts know as well. Lastly, we will also be getting. Since you're having the hemoptysis, like coughing up blood, we might also do a chest X ray to see if you have active tb. So those are some of the things that we'll get started with. Is that okay with you? Any questions or concerns?
P: No, nothing like that. Do I need to isolate?
D: Yeah. So we will keep you in an isolated room right now when you're getting all those tests. And if you do have tb, you will need to isolate and stay away from contacts, not be at work. If you do, in fact, have tb, which it seems likely right now, you will be started in hospital on, of, like, antibiotic therapy, which consists of, like, four different medications. And people with active TV will do have to isolate during that time period. So, yeah, we'll get some of those tests done and we'll get back to you as soon as possible.
P: Okay, great. Thank you.
D: You're welcome.
