D: What brings you in today?
P: I'm just here because I've been experiencing some breathlessness as well as a bit of cough.
D: Okay. When did it start?
P: So I think it started around three months ago, and I believe it's been getting worse.
D: Okay. How often are you experiencing the shortness of breath?
P: I feel it, like, a lot of the time, especially outside when I'm in the cold or when I go outside at night. My chest just feels a little tight too, at the same time.
D: Okay. And how long does it last?
P: I would say it lasts up to an hour every time I'm out in the cold, and then once I come back in. So I'd say it lasts at least one hour.
D: Okay. Does anything else make it worse, like dust, you know, laying down, anything like that?
P: Sometimes when I'm near dust, sometimes when I'm running during gym class. Increased activity does make it worse.
D: Okay. Okay. And if you were to describe the quality of your breathing difficulties, is it more like a burning kind of feeling? Is it like you can't catch your breath? What does it feel like?
P: I think it's more just I can't catch my breath, and it feels like my. My throat is just kind of like closing off and I can't take deep breaths.
D: Okay. Yeah, that's scary. And one to ten, ten being the worst. How bad is your shortness of breath?
P: It can get up to, I would say, like an 8 at times. It can get pretty scary. And sometimes, like, I feel like heaviness in my chest too, when it happens.
D: Yeah. And the coughing, has it been going on for as long as your breathlessness?
P: I would say around the same time frame? Like three months. But I'm not always coughing. It comes and goes.
D: Okay. And for your coughing, is it kind of like the same triggers, like cold, dust, things like that? Okay.
P: Yeah, I would say so.
D: And do you ever have. Do you ever cough up blood?

D: Okay. So no sputum or phlegm?
P: No.

P: I think that was, like, more than three years ago.
D: Okay. Okay. Any recent surgeries?
P: Nope.
D: No. Are you on any medications?
P: I just take some Tylenol, sometimes for the, like, Tylenol, cold, sometimes for the symptoms. I don't think it has really helped.

P: No.
D: No. Okay. And any travel recently?
P: No, I've been here in Ontario.
D: Okay, and where do you live?
P: So I currently live in London, but I just recently moved into a new flat around two months ago.
D: Two months ago. Okay. Is it more? Is it an older flat?
P: No, it's fairly new. But one thing I did notice. I don't know if this has anything to do with it, but my flatmate actually smokes, and sometimes that can really irritate and make me cough more. Sometimes at night.
D: Yeah. Any pets?
P: No, I don't have any pets.
D: Okay. And do you smoke?
P: No, I don't smoke, no.

D: Okay. How about alcohol? Do you drink alcohol?
P: Just, like, maybe sometimes at parties, but very rarely. Maybe. I would say once a month.
D: Okay. Okay. And is there anything that you wanted to discuss today that I missed?
P: No, I think that that was all, like, just the shortness of breath was scaring me a little bit.
D: Yeah.
P: And just the coughing, but other than that, I just wanted to know what. What's going on.
D: Okay. Yeah. And you mentioned you are otherwise healthy, so you don't have any history of asthma or anything like that, right?
P: No, no one's ever told me that. But my sister has asthma. So I was wondering, maybe.
D: Have you ever experienced shortness of breath when you were younger with, like, exercise?
P: Not really. Just maybe like the normal amount. Like, if I'm running around too much, I feel shortness of breath, but I think it just got worse over the last few months.
D: Okay. And then have you ever had any imaging done in the past, like a chest X ray, or investigations, like a pulmonary function test?
P: No, I don't recall having any of that done.
D: Okay. All right, well, those are all the questions I had for you. If you didn't have anything else to add. I guess we will conclude by saying that what you have, we have a differential diagnosis for this. It sounds like what you have is asthma since your symptoms started three months ago when you moved into a flat with your friends. And it seems like smoking and cold is triggering that. So we'll work you up with pulmonary function tests to start, and we'll see if bronchodilators will help with your symptoms. And if it doesn't, we'll also rule out other things like pneumonia or like allergic rhinitis. How does that sound?
P: Yeah, that sounds good.
D: Okay, sounds great. Well, we'll see you soon then.
P: All right. Thank you.
D: Take care.
P: You too.
