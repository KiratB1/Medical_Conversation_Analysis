D: How may I help you?
P: Hi. I just want to talk about these times when I feel like I'm just. I'm suffocating and I just can't breathe and it's pretty scary and I don't know what's going on.
D: Yeah, certainly feeling short of breath like that can be quite scary, for sure. When do these episodes kind of happen? Are they spontaneous or can you think of things that you're doing when they come on?
P: I don't know. It's just like sometimes like before interviews. Sometimes just kind of random. Yeah, I can kind of tell when they're about to come on. Yeah, I think it's mostly like job interviews.
D: Okay. Have you had many of those recently?
P: Job interview? Yeah, I got. I got. I got laid off because of the pandemic and now I've been looking for a job and. Yeah, it's just like. It's kind of nerve wracking, but also like. I don't know, I'm not just worried. It could be something else. Like, it's just. Yeah, it's like I really just can't breathe. It's so weird.
D: Okay. Yeah, it certainly sounds like there's been a lot of stress recently. Certainly plenty with the pandemic as well. And so when you get short of breath, you said you have this. You can feel that it's coming on. And how long does it last? For.
P: Like 15 minutes? 15, 20 minutes.
D: Is there anything you do to help it go away?
P: I'll just go and lie down and close my eyes.
D: Okay. And do you get short of breath if you walk far distances or exert yourself?
P: Oh, no, no. I go out for a run every single day. Nothing happened at that time.
D: Okay, and have you had a cough?
P: No.
D: Any wheezing?
P: No.
D: Okay. And have you had any. Any chest pain?
P: Yeah, I kind of feel like this pressure at that time. It's just like. Yeah, someone's like pressing my chest inwards kind of. It's hard to explain.
D: I see. Do you. Is it like, do you feel it in any one particular spot or.
P: No, I just feel like my chest is really tight and it just. It's like I can't like, expand my lungs.
D: I see. And does this last around 15 minutes as well?
P: Yeah.
D: Okay. And similarly, you're like going for runs and stuff like that. You don't ever get any chest pain?
P: No, no, no.

P: No, no, I have not had a cough.
D: Oh, no. Okay. Sorry. That's okay. Okay. And have you otherwise been well or have you had any infectious symptoms like a runny or red eyes, a runny nose or a sore throat?
P: No, none of those.
D: Alright, so have you had any headaches?
P: No.
D: How about any fevers or chills?

P: I've been diagnosed with depression.
D: Okay. And have you had panic attacks before?
P: No. But do you think that's what's going on?
D: Potentially. It certainly can't rule out an organic cause meaning something going on otherwise just yet. We need to do some a physical exam and some investigations first, but it certainly could be related to that with all of the stressors that are going on. And so you've had a low mood. Have you had any periods in your life where you felt really energetic, like you didn't need any sleep, you're really talkative, you had all the energy in the world?
P: I wish. No, I've never really felt that way.

P: No.
D: All right. And you mentioned you've been diagnosed with depression. Have you been diagnosed with any other medical conditions?
P: No.
D: Okay. Are you on any medications right now?
P: No, I was doing pretty well. I used to have these episodes of depression when I was younger, as a teenager, and they kind of went away. I was on meds at that time, but I think. I think it's coming back now.
D: Okay, so you haven't been on medication now for. For quite a while. For years.
P: For, like, say, 12 years? 13 years.
D: Okay. What did you use then, if you can remember?
P: Prozac.

D: Okay. And anybody in the family have problems with mental illness?
P: My mom has depression, too.
D: Okay, Anybody in the family have problems with substance use?
P: No.
D: Okay. And I think that's everything that I wanted to ask on History Today. So you've been having these episodes where you get really short of breath and you get chest pain, you'll get sweaty and have what sounds like an impending sense of doom where you kind of feel like it's coming on and it lasts for 15 minutes and not related to exercise. Were there any other symptoms or things that you've been experiencing recently?
P: Yeah, it's also. I also feel like my heart's, like, breathing really fast.
D: Oh, okay. And does that. How long does that last for?
P: Same time, like, everything just sort of comes on at the same time, just kind of goes away together.
D: Okay. Would you say that it comes on, like, kind of like at the snap of your finger sort of thing, like, really quickly, and then.
P: I can kind of tell that it's going to come on, like I have a sense of it, and then it just, like, starts suddenly, just happens.
D: Okay, so you have the heart racing. Are there any other symptoms as well?
P: I don't think so.
D: Okay, so we will get an ECG and have a look at that. But I'm concerned now, thinking that this might be related to anxiety or panic attacks. And so I guess that'll be something that we could discuss more about in regards to, like, I guess, previous traumas and things that. And the stresses that you might be dealing with currently to help manage the stress better.
P: Sure. Thank you.
