D: That's good. And this is. Just wanted to let you know that anything that you talk about in here with us stays confidential and won't leave this room unless there is potential harm to yourself or others. So have you tried any recreational drugs like marijuana? Have you tried smoking or alcohol at all?
P: No, I've been trying. I stay away from that. That sort of thing. I know of other people in my class who have and stuff, but I always just. I'm just trying to stay as ready as I can for the sports.
D: Okay, that's good. And, yeah. So. And are you up to date with all your immunizations?
P: Yeah, I am. Yeah. My mom made sure that I got all of that stuff done.
D: Okay. All right. So, yeah, those are some questions I had. I just have a few more questions with regards to just examining your knee. Are you able to walk or do you have any kind of a limp?
P: No limp. I can walk.
D: Okay. Okay. And are you able to run?
P: Yeah, I can run, but when I do, it causes some pain. I'm able to still run, but, yeah, it hurts.
D: Okay. And so when you palpate your lower knee just under the patella, you said it's a sharp pain, right?
P: Yeah, exactly. And then when it's. And it feels kind of achy after practice or something like that, but if you press on it, it's sharp.
D: I see. And any. Any kind of, like. Are you able to flex and extend your knee right now if you tried?
P: I can, yeah.
D: Okay. And have you noticed any kind of rotation of your knee at all?
P: No. Nothing like that?
D: No. Okay. Okay. And no weakness below your knee, right?
P: No weakness. I just feel like my muscles are really tight. Like my thigh and my hamstring muscles. I think I need to stretch them out some more. They do just feel tight.
D: Okay. And do you notice any kind of swelling or redness or bruising in the area?
P: No.
D: No. Okay. And your ankle and hips, you don't have any pain or issues with movement, right?
P: No, not at all. No. No problems with my ankle or hip.
D: Okay. All right. Yeah. So those are just all the questions I had for you today. Do you have any questions?
P: I was just wondering what I can do to make this go away.
D: Yeah. So definitely this is something that is what we call jumper's knee. It's fairly common amongst younger athletes, especially those that play sports like volleyball or basketball. But right now we don't really need to do any kind of imaging or anything like that. It seems like you're in the earlier phases, and it's good that you came in. We definitely do need to manage it with some conservative management where we're gonna keep having. Taking a look at it as well as I would recommend icing it every, like, for a half an hour, like, around four to six times a day, especially after you're doing your activities. Then you can. You can take the. Continue taking the Tylenol and Advil as well. As long as you're following the maximum amount per day, depending on if you're taking extra strength. Tylenol, for example, versus the regular strength. And then I will also refer you to some physiotherapy that will kind of teach you some strengthening and stretching exercises that you can do to help. What we call what you might be having is just some inflammation in your patellar tendon right below your patella. So we need to strengthen the muscles around it. So we'll do some referral to physiotherapy, and then we'll see how you. You do based on all those treatment options. And then if it gets worse, and if. Or if it doesn't get better, we might need to do some imaging, either ultrasound or an mri, and then see where to go from there. But for now, does that sound okay with you?
P: It does, yeah. Thank you. So you said that you think it's like a patellar tendonitis or something like that?
D: Yeah, it's patellar tendonitis. It's commonly called the jumper's knee, and it should resolve with the steps that we. Especially since it seems like you're in the earlier stages. So it seems like it should be pretty responsive. But if it isn't, there are other steps we can discuss in the future.
P: Okay, that sounds great. Thank you.
