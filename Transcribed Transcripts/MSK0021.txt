D: What can I do for you?
P: Hi there. I've had this pain in my knee that's been going on for a few weeks now, and it hasn't gone away, and so I thought I would get checked out. It's been really impacting my running. I just haven't been able to run as often as I would like to. And so that's why I wanted to get this looked at.

D: Okay. All right. And what kind of makes it worse or better.
P: So if I'm. While running, we'll bug it. But I think, like, the main things that if I'm walking downstairs or if I'm squatting, I like to lift weights as well. And yeah, I can barely even do body weight now because if I'm squatting down, it causes a lot of pain. It's a sharp pain.

P: No, I don't think so. Everybody's been healthy.
D: Okay. Okay. And travel anywhere?
P: Nope, we've been at home.
D: Okay. Okay. All right, So I think those are all the questions that I had for you. Let's move on to the physical exam part of this interview, if that's okay with you. So I'm going To get you to take a look at both your knees and let me know if you see more redness or swelling in your left knee compared to your right.
P: No, I'm not noticing any swelling.
D: Do you see any redness?
P: No. No redness?
D: No. Okay. How about any atrophy, deformities, or skin changes in your left knee compared to your right knee?
P: No. Nothing like that?
D: No. Okay, I'm going to get you to press down and palpate on your quadriceps. On both knee? Sorry? On both thighs. Do you feel any pain there?
P: No pain there.
D: Okay. How about when you press down on your kneecaps?
P: Yeah, I do get some pain when I push on the. On the kneecap. On my left knee.
D: On your left knee. Okay. How about just below that where your shins start?
P: No pain there.
D: No pain there. And then how about on the lateral aspects of your knee?
P: No pain there.
D: And then the medial aspects of your knee?
P: No pain there.
D: No pain there. Okay, good. When you were palpating, was there a difference in temperature between the left and right knee? Was the left knee a little bit more warm than the right knee?
P: No, the temperature feels the same.
D: Okay. Okay, good. So now I'm going to. Are you sitting down?
P: I am, yes.
D: Okay, so from a sitting position, I'm going to get you to stand up and you let me know if that is painful.
P: It is. Yeah.
D: Yeah. Okay. And then how about when you bend your knees?
P: No pain with just bending.
D: Okay. How about when you. When you flex your hips so you can do one leg at a time? Does that hurt?
P: No, that doesn't hurt.
D: Okay. How about squatting down?
P: That does hurt. Yeah, squatting hurts.
D: Squatting hurts. Okay. Okay. And then how about when you point your toes towards the ceiling?
P: No pain.
D: Okay. How about when you point your toes towards the ground?
P: No pain.
D: No pain. So no pain on dorsiflexion or plantar flexion. Okay. Do you hear any, like, popping or crackling sounds in your knees when you climb stairs or when you're standing up after sitting down for a long time?
P: Yeah, yeah, sometimes I will hear some. Some like. Yeah, crackling sounds.
D: Okay. All right. And yeah, you mentioned that you do a lot of running. Do you do any other sorts of exercises?
P: Yeah, I'll do some weightlifting and, like, cycling as well. I mean, all kinds of different stuff, like staying as active as I can.
D: Okay. All right. Yeah. Given your young age and the fact that you do a lot of running and a lot of physical activity like cycling and lifting weights, what you have is most Likely something called patella femoral syndrome. And that is basically a nerve kind of pain in the soft tissues and bone around your kneecap. And it basically happens because of overuse. So vigorous physical activities that put repeated stress on your knees, like running and cycling, can cause that or just like improper sports training techniques. And we can do a few things that, that'll help with the pain. So for a little bit, if you could hold off on the running, that would be good. So in the meantime, while you're, while you switch to like low impact activities, whether that's like riding a stationary bike or swimming, you can also try something called the RICE method. So that stands for resting. So avoiding putting any strain on that knee. Using ice packs for several days compression. So wrapping your knee in like an elastic bandage, as well as elevating your knees higher than your, than the level of your chest can help. And then with sharp pains, you can also take ibuprofen for pain management. Yeah, so we can start there. If it doesn't get better, we can also order an X ray just to rule out other things that could have caused this pain in your knee. And if none of those non surgical treatments work. Oh, sorry, I also forgot to mention, we'll also refer you to physiotherapy to help you with the range of motion and strengthened endurance. But if none of those non surgical treatments work, we'll also refer you to like an arthroscopy or some sort of surgery that may be able to fix the issue more permanently. Does that sound okay?
P: It does, yeah. Thank you.
D: Okay. Yeah, no worries.
