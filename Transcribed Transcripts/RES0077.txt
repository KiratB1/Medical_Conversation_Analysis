D: Okay. Yeah. Those are all the questions I had today. It seems that definitely there are some concerning symptoms like shortness of breath and cough, especially also the loss of smell that you're having. We definitely want to make sure that you don't have the virus like coronavirus. So we will do a test for you today. And what we recommend in the meantime is to self isolate, even in your home, wear a mask around your family if you can, like eat separately, don't go outside and be off of work until the test results come back. And then even after that, you might need to follow instructions of public health and self isolate for 14 days. If not coronavirus, hopefully, then it can also be other things like other viruses can cause similar symptoms as well. But yeah, so we'll just get that test done and then see where to go from there.
P: Okay, that sounds great.
D: Thank you. All right, you're welcome. Take care. Bye.
