D: Understood. And have you ever used IV drugs?
P: No.
D: No. Okay. And when was your last menstrual period?
P: It was a year ago.
D: A year ago. And then otherwise? We talked a little bit about recent travel. It sounds like you had a hiking trip last week and you passed some people. But it sounds like your husband also has kind of similar symptoms that you do right now.
P: Yeah.
D: Okay, Sounds good. Now, we've already talked about kind of past medical issues. Moving on. I think what we'll do next is move on to a physical exam. But before I do that, do you have any questions for me or anything else you feel I should know?
P: No. Do you think I have Covid?
D: It's a possibility. It's always good to rule these things out. So I'll be ordering a Covid swab no matter what. Obviously with any presentation where we have someone come in with a fever and sore throat, we want to rule out anything infectious. So it sounds like if your husband got it and you have it, Covid would be our first thing that we want to rule out. So just while we're trying to investigate, work this up further. Want to have you and your husband self isolate. The other question I suppose I should ask is have you gone to your flu shot this year?
P: No, I haven't.
D: So there's also possibility it might be influenza. Just the seasonal flu. But until we I suppose rule out Covid, it would best just to keep to yourself just in case you are infectious for the meanwhile.
P: Okay? Sure.
D: All right, I'm gonna go talk to the doctor and I'll be coming back in to see you. Okay?
P: All right, great. Thank you.
D: Take care.
