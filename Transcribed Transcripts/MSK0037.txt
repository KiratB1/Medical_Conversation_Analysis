D: How may I help you?
P: Yeah, I just came in here today. I've been experiencing some difficulties with my right hand, especially at the bases of the fourth and fifth digits. I noticed this happening over the last, I would say probably last few months it's been getting worse. I've been having trouble just kind of extending those two fingers and I kind of see like this little bump at the base of those two fingers. So yeah, overall it's just been difficult working. I'm a construction worker and I don't know, this just keeps getting worse.
D: Okay, and you noticed and sorry, when exactly did it start?
P: Probably two months ago.
D: Two months ago. And it's the fourth and fifth digits. Are any other fingers involved or any part, other parts of your hand?
P: No, it's just those two.
D: Okay, and how would you describe the pain that you're feeling? Is it a sharp pain and an achy pain or a burning pain?
P: It's more kind of like an aching, aching pain which gets worse if I try to extend those fingers. And yeah, like I do feel like the little nodules but like pressing on them doesn't hurt or anything like that.
D: Okay, and do you feel any radiation of pain like into your hand or forearm?
P: No, not really.
D: Okay. And is there anything that is aggravating or making the pain worse?
P: I think just extending. It's, it's, I would say more than the pain. It's just like discomfort and just not being able to extend that is frustrating. Like the pain isn't that bad. Like there's and like minimal pain.
D: Okay. And is there any like clicking or. Yeah, any clicking or catching when you're trying to like extend the finger?
P: I would say there is, yeah, there's some like catching, I would say when I'm trying to extend.
D: Okay, and has there been anything that you've tried recently that's improved the discomfort or helped with the range of motion?
P: No, nothing that I've tried that has really helped. And yeah, I'm just afraid if I stop kind of exercising and I'll just keep getting worse.
D: Okay. Yeah, certainly. Okay. And what. Have you had any problems with your hand before? Like any trauma there or anything like that?
P: My. Yeah, I'm a construction worker so there's always like a lot of. I haven't had any falls or injuries on my hands luckily, but there's always just constant lifting. There's. I used to drill a lot too, so there's like always constant. And I'm right handed as well, so there's always like the vibration and yeah, so. But no. No direct, like, traumas or falls.

D: Okay, I see. And that's good.
P: And.
D: Anybody in the family have any musculoskeletal or neurological conditions that. That run in the family?
P: Not that I know of.
D: Okay, and how about any autoimmune conditions like rheumatoid arthritis or hypothyroidism?
P: Nope.
D: Okay, and has anybody in the family had a dupuytrens contracture before?
P: No, I haven't heard it. No.
D: Okay, and so next, I just wanted to go on to the physical exam portion. So just a couple more questions. So when you're looking at your hand, are you seeing any swelling, redness?
P: Not swelling. I just. Yeah, just those nodules. And I get like, a little bit of whiteness around those nodules when I extend my fingers.
D: Okay, but no redness?
P: No.
D: Okay. And are you. Are you seeing any, like, muscle atrophy or any deformities of any of your joints in the fingers or the wrist?
P: Nope.
D: Okay. And are there any areas that. That you can palpate over your hand that. That causes pain?
P: Yeah, there's just some discomfort, like when I. At the bases of those two fingers, like, if I press on the nodules, like, it's sometimes a little bit uncomfortable, but it's not too bad. Like, I don't. But I don't know. I have a pretty high pain threshold, too, so it's hard to say.
D: Okay, I see. And when you're extending your fingers with, like, passive extension to do it with your other hand, do you get a lot of pain, like, along the tendons or the Passive extension?
P: Yeah, definitely. I would say more painful than if I try to extend it myself, like, just forcing it back, but. Yeah, but not. Not anything too. Like, I. Like it's not sharp or anything like that.
D: Okay. And with the kno on the nodules and stuff, do you feel any, like, crepitations or, like, crackling or rubbing over those. Those areas or your palm.
P: Crackling? No, not that I have noticed. No.
D: Okay. And any issues with your, like, wrist or. Or elbow?
P: No, not that I know of.
D: Okay, so I think that's everything that I wanted to ask about today. Did you have anything that you wanted to add or did you have any questions?
P: No, I think that's all.
D: Okay. So right now it's sounding like it's most likely something called Dupuytren's contracture. But also, we can't rule out, like, flexor tenosynovitis just yet or trigger finger, based on the. The symptoms, but the fact that you're not having a fever, you don't have pain kind of along the. The tendon, you're not seeing any swelling or redness, that's all pointing away from the tenosynovitis. But it'll be important to get some blood work and things to make sure that we're not missing that. But for Dupuytren's contracture, it'll be a. Doing what we can with therapy to try, like, physiotherapy and activity modification to try and loosen those structures on the. On the palm of your hand.
P: Okay, sounds good.
