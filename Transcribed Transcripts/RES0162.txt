D: What brings you in today?
P: Hi. I'm just coming in because for the last couple months I've been having just these coughing fits, either, like, when I'm going to the gym or even at home, like during the weekends when we're vacuuming and cleaning the house.
D: When did this start?
P: I would say started probably three months back, but it's gotten worse. So, like, before, I used to, like, just have some irritation in my throat and cough a little bit, but now I would say probably every other day I'm having these episodes where I can't stop coughing when I'm exercising.
D: And is this cough a dry cough or do you bring up mucus?
P: It's usually a dry cough. Sometimes I do bring up, like, this white material, but usually it's mostly a dry cough.
D: You've never noticed any blood, right?
P: No, no blood.
D: Okay. And it started about three months ago, I guess. Before that, did you ever have a problem when you would exercise or when you were vacuuming or cleaning? Has this been a problem that has occurred for years and that's just something that you. That got worse and now it's come to your attention, or was it just very new and sudden three months ago?
P: It's fairly new. I've never really had this issue before, although I have been like. So I. After the new year and the winter, I wasn't much of the person who ran or exercised a lot, but it kind of made it a new goal to become more fit and active. So I noticed that. I don't know if maybe that's why, like, it is something new that I've been trying, but, yeah, it's not been an issue before.
D: Okay. And other than the. The cough, have you noticed any other symptoms, like a sore throat or itchy eyes, itchy nose, stuffy nose or runny nose, anything like that?
P: None of those, but I did initially, I used to get just an irritation in my throat, but now it's just more of a cough.
D: Okay. Do you have. Do you get any pain in your chest at all?
P: When I'm. When I'm. Usually it goes away in, like, 10, 15 minutes, but if I'm coughing a lot, I do get some tightness.
D: Okay. Do you ever feel like you're short of breath when you're coughing or otherwise?
P: I do find that it's harder to take a breath at those times.
D: And how long do these last for?
P: Episodes last for probably 15 to 20 minutes. And yeah, it's. It's mainly just after. I, like, oftentimes over the last few weeks, I'VE had to just stop doing what I'm doing, like exercising and just come home and rest.
D: Do you feel like your heart's beating really fast when that happens or you're sweating?
P: Yeah, yeah, I feel like it's usually, I don't know if it's because of the exercise, but I have like a Fitbit and it's. My heart rate is much faster.
D: Okay. Right. Have you had any other symptoms? So anything, any pain in your belly or any nausea or vomiting?
P: No, nothing like that.
D: Any changes in your bowel movements or any urinary symptoms?
P: Nope.
D: Any headaches or fevers or chills?
P: No, nothing like that.
D: Unintentional weight loss?
P: Nope.
D: Any night sweats?
P: No.
D: Muscle aches, joint pains?
P: No.
D: Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
P: No, I've been very healthy.
D: You mentioned that you started going to the gym more often earlier this year and that is when you sort of noticed some of these symptoms. Is there anything else that changed in your life, any big changes that you think could be related to this?
P: No, not really. I haven't really. I moved back to my parents home just for a bit right now while the university has closed down. But I've lived there all my life before, so I don't know if that has anything to do with it.
D: Do you feel like they may have put new curtains or like there's old carpets or a new pet or something that could have caused some irritation for you?
P: No, but I have noticed that when I, when we vacuum, I do get some of those symptoms as well. Just more of an irritation, more so than the cough.
D: Okay. Okay. And do you feel that you're particularly anxious when these episodes are occurring? Do you have any new stressors in life?
P: No, not really.
D: Okay. Any medical conditions that run in the family?
P: I don't think so, not that I know of.
D: Okay. And I guess a little bit more about you. So have you had in the past when you were younger, did you have a rash like eczema or did you have allergic rhinitis where you would sneeze and to feel ill when you were outside or at certain times of the year, anything like that?
P: I didn't have any like eczema or rashes, but I do generally have get allergies during the springtime when I go outside.
D: Do you take any medications for that?
P: Yeah, I just take reactant, usually during the spring.
D: Do you have any other allergies to food or medications?
P: No, not that I know.
D: And other than reactant, do you take any medications, including over the counter meds no, nothing else. Okay. And in your family you said no one has asthma or allergic rhinitis or eczema or anything like that, right?
P: Not asthma. My dad also gets those allergies and irritations, just like me.
D: Okay. And you mentioned that you're staying at your parents place. Are you doing things from home? Are you like doing school from home or working from home?

P: Yeah, alcohol I've had like at university, but generally maybe just on the weekends. No, not anything regular.
D: All right. Okay. Well, those are all the questions I had for you. We will do a physical exam now and I'll go talk to my attending and we'll come talk to you right after, I guess before. Before I do. So what exactly are you hoping to get out of today's visit?
P: I just wanted, like, I really do want to become fit. And it's just these symptoms are stopping me and kind of affecting my daily routine. So I just wanted to know what I can do to stop having these symptoms.
