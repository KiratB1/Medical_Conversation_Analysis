So with your symptoms of having kind of a fever, cough, and being tired, definitely concerned of a viral infection and possibly COVID 19 or something more common, like the common colds, like an adenovirus. We'll do some testing for COVID 19 with a nasal PCR swab as well as run some blood work, because there is a possibility that there's a bacterial infection, such as, like, a pneumonia or a lower respiratory tract infection that would be treated with antibiotics. So we. Yeah, we'll order those investigations along with a chest X ray, and we'll go from there.
P: Okay, that sounds great. Thank you so much.
D: You're welcome.
