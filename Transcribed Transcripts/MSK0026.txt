D: How may I help you?
P: I'm here because my right knee is very painful. It looks kind of swollen, and it's also a little bit warm. So I'm just worried. I'm worried about it, and I was wondering if you could look at it.
D: Yeah, certainly. So where are you feeling the. The pain? Exactly.
P: So it's where? So right in the middle of my knee, so just below the bone, the big knee bone.
D: Okay, so like, underneath the kneecap, like below that?
P: Yeah, just a little bit below.
D: Okay, so slightly below the patella. Sounds like somewhere in the region of the tibial tuberosity. Okay, and when did this pain start?
P: It started about two weeks ago.
D: Okay, two weeks ago, when the pain started, was there any trauma or could you remember any movement that, um, that caused the pain?
P: Nothing like that. But I recently found out that I had some osteoarthritis on my left knee. So I was trying to put more pressure on my right knee when. Whenever I was doing, like, gardening work. And I think something. Something may have happened when I was doing that. Something maybe. Maybe I put too much strain on it.
D: Okay, I see. And, like, are you doing a lot of kneeling on. On or during the gardening work?
P: I am.
D: Okay, and how long has the pain been going on for? Has it been constant over these two weeks?
P: Yes, it has been.
D: Okay, and how would you describe the pain? Is it sharp, burning, achy?
P: I would say mostly achy, but it can be sharp.
D: Okay, and do you feel the pain radiate anywhere else?
P: No, just. It's pretty local.
D: Okay. Have you tried anything to make the pain better?
P: I tried some topical. Like, what are those? Like, ice and fire gels? Those seem to help temporarily, but the pain comes back.
D: Okay, and have you. Has anything made the pain worse?
P: I guess, like, when I kneel down on it, it gets painful. Or if I touch it or palpate, gets painful. If I'm flexing my knee too much, that hurts as well. Kind of keeping it straight and not touching it makes it feel better.
D: Okay, and what would you say the severity of the pain is? With 10 being the worst pain you've ever felt and one being the least.
P: Pain, I'd give it about a six.
D: Okay, and have you had a pain like this in your right knee before?
P: No, nothing like this. I have osteoarthritis in my left knee, but it feels different.

D: Okay. Are you currently working right now?
P: Yes, I am.
D: Okay. And what do you do?
P: I work as a full time gardener for a landscaping company.
D: Okay, I see. So you're spending a lot of time doing kind of like repetitive kneeling type movements to do your job?
P: Yes, that's right.
D: Okay. And do you smoke cigarettes?
P: I don't.
D: Alright. And do you drink alcohol?
P: I'll have a glass of wine every other night.
D: Okay. And do you use any recreational drugs?
P: No, I don't.
D: Have you used anything like that in the past?
P: No.
D: Like IV drugs. Okay. And in the family, or is there a history of any musculoskeletal or neurological conditions?
P: No.
D: Okay, next. I just wanted to do the physical exam portion and ask you to have a look at the knee first and let me know if you're having any swelling, redness, or warmth to the knee compared to the other side.
P: Sure.
D: Sorry. So you're having. So you are having swelling, warmth, and redness to the right knee?
P: Yes.
D: Okay. And are you having pain to, like, palpation? Is there a specific spot you can press on that that causes a sharp pain?
P: So just below the kneecap area, there's some swelling there. And when I press down on that swollen area, it causes a bit of pain.
D: Okay. And are you able to fully bend and straighten the knee?
P: I can do that, but when I bend my knee, it really hurts.
D: Okay. And are you able to walk normally or do you have a limp?
P: I can walk normally. It just hurts.
D: Okay. So that was everything that I wanted to ask today on the history and physical. Was there anything that you. Maybe I forgot about, you wanted to add?
P: No, I don't think so.
D: Okay, so right now it's sounding like this could possibly be a knee bursitis or pre. Patellar or. Sorry, an infrapatellar bursitis or a prepatellar bursitis, which are the kind of the. The more common types. One thing to make sure that we rule out would be aseptic bursitis. Although you're not having any fevers or chills, so that makes it a little bit less likely. But if your symptoms are getting worse and you're developing a fever and it's becoming even more painful, then certainly we'll have to rule out an infection. And as well, if things are not improving, potentially a structural disease in the knee, such as a meniscal injury or like a ligamental injury from all of the kneeling and repetitive movements. But right now I think it's mostly sounding like a knee bursitis.
P: Okay.
D: Okay. And treatment for that will be activity modification, as well as using things like NSAIDs and icing to help with the inflammation.
P: Okay, that sounds good. Thank you.
