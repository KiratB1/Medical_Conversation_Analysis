D: Okay. Those were all the questions that I had. Did you have any concerns, any questions, anything that you wanted to discuss that I possibly missed today?
P: Nope. That was everything, then. Thank you.
D: Okay, no problem. So what we'll do is we'll get a Covid swab on you just because your symptoms do overlap with those of COVID So we want to make sure that that's not what you have. So we'll take a swab, you'll hear back in about 24 to 48 hours. But in the meantime, you still should isolate for 14 days, and that includes trying to isolate from your family members as well when possible. And Public Health will be in touch to let you know to do some contact tracing. If it's not Covid, you could possibly have some sort of other viral infection that's going around these days. How does that sound?
P: Yeah, it sounds great. Thank you.
D: All right, no worries.
