D: What brings you in today?
P: So I've just had this pain in my chest for just over a week now, and it's caused me to have trouble breathing.
D: Okay. How old are you, Jen?
P: 52.
D: 52. Okay. When did this pain start? You said a week back.
P: Yeah, just about that. I think maybe eight days ago.
D: Okay. And is it a constant pain? Is it always there?
P: It is, but it's definitely worse that it's the breathing that's been bothering me a lot more. When I take a deep breath, the pain's a lot worse.
D: Okay. Okay. And when you do get that. Get that pain, how long does it last?
P: I would say I don't know, 15, 20 minutes. It goes away over time.
D: Okay. And the shortness of breath, do you have that at rest as well?
P: No, if I take a break or sit down to rest, then I can usually catch my breath. But if, even if I'm doing a little bit of exertion, like walking a few blocks or something like that, I'm finding I'm short of breath.
D: Okay. Did anything trigger this a week back? Any trauma to the chest area, anything like that? No.
P: No one else has been sick. I had a cough about a week ago, and so I thought it might be a chest infection, but I'm not feverish, so I'm not sure.
D: Okay. The cough, is it still there?
P: Yeah, it's. I still have a cough.
D: Okay. And are you coughing up any blood?

D: No. Okay. And do you feel like you're wheezing?
P: No wheezing?
D: No wheezing. Okay. The shortness of breath, 1 to 10, 10 being the worst, the most severe. How bad is your shortness of breath?
P: I would say when I'm exerting myself, it could get up to like a seven or an eight.
D: Okay. And you mentioned how far can you walk before you need to rest?
P: I would say maybe 100 meters. Before I was able to run, I was running a few days per week, so.

P: No, I haven't.
D: Okay. And are you otherwise healthy? Do you have any past medical history of any conditions, really?
P: No. Like, I've been previously healthy, but I guess I did have a hysterectomy a few weeks ago. I didn't bring it up before because it's just a day procedure, but I was definitely spending a lot more time relaxing at home after that a few weeks ago.
D: Okay. Okay. So you haven't been moving around as much? I guess so, since the hysterectomy.
P: Yeah, exactly. It was starting to get. The pain was starting to improve, but it was keeping me on the couch a lot of days.
D: Okay. Yeah. Are you on any medications?
P: No. I've tried some Tylenol and Advil for the pain throughout this week, and it didn't really help much, but other than that, don't take any medications? Nothing for blood pressure or anything like that.
D: Okay. And, sorry, what was the hysterectomy for?
P: I was having a lot of bleeding.
D: Okay, so were they thinking it was like a cancer or something?
P: I think it was from fibroids.
D: Oh, okay. Okay. And so you mentioned no medications, any allergies?
P: No allergies to medications?
D: No. And are you up to date with any. With all your immunizations?
P: I am. Yeah.
D: You are. Okay. Any family history of lung conditions?
P: No lung conditions.
D: Okay. How about heart?
P: Yeah, my mom had a heart attack when she was 56.
D: Okay. Okay. I'm sorry to hear that.
P: And.
D: Any family history of something called pulmonary embolism or dvts?
P: No, I haven't heard of pulmonary embolism before.
D: Okay, so it's basically blood clots in your lung, and then DVTS are deep vein thrombosis. So also blood clots, but in different parts of your body.
P: Okay, yeah.
D: Anything like that that you know of?
P: No. I might have heard of something like that happening in my mom, actually, that might have been related to her heart attack, but I'm not specifically sure.
D: Okay, sure. And Jen, do you smoke?
P: I smoke maybe about half a pack of cigarettes per day. I've smoked ever since I was a teenager. I've tried to quit multiple times. I was smoking about a pack per day before, so I have cut it down. But still something that I'm working on.
D: Okay, good. I'm glad you're trying to cut down. We have resources available if you're interested in some more help. And do you smoke marijuana?
P: No, I don't.
D: Okay. Any use of other recreational drugs?
P: No.
D: No. Okay. And how about alcohol? Do you drink alcohol?
P: Maybe a glass of wine on the weekends, but other than that, no.
D: Okay. And have you had any sick contacts recently? People around you, People you live with at work?
P: I can't think of any. Anybody who's been sick? No.
D: Okay. Okay. And. And what do you do for work, Jen?
P: I work as an administrator at. At a bank.
D: Okay. Okay. And have you traveled anywhere recently?
P: No, I can't remember the last vacation.
D: Okay. All right, so those were all the questions that I had for you. Did you have anything that you wanted to add? Anything that I hadn't touched on?
P: No, I think you covered everything. Thank you.
D: Okay. Yeah, no worries. So I guess at this point we would do a physical exam. Just take a listen to your lungs and your chest after that. So right now it sounds like it could be something vascular, you know, like a pulmonary embolism. Like we talked about. That's kind of high on my list of things to work up for. But also, we don't want to miss other things, you know, like cancer, infection, autoimmune, things that could affect your lungs. So we'll just do a workup for all of that. How does that sound?
P: Yeah, whatever. Whatever you think we need to do.
D: Okay. Sounds good. Thank you for your time.
P: Yeah, thank you.
