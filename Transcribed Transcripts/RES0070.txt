D: I was wondering if we could start with you telling us what brought you in today.
P: Yeah, absolutely. I have had this awful, awful headache for the past two days. I want to say it's horrible.
D: Okay. Has the headache stayed the same, gotten worse, gotten any better?
P: It's only gotten worse over the past two days.
D: Okay, and when the headache started, was it like a thunderclap kind of worst headache of your life when it came on? Okay, was there anything going on two days ago around the time of the headache? Like, did you hit your head or anything like that?
P: No, I just went out for dinner the night before. And I know that there are certain foods that can trigger my migraines, but this really feels different. It doesn't feel like my migraine.
D: Okay, and have you had any other associated symptoms with the headache?
P: I've been feeling really tired. I took the day off yesterday, and today I'm working from home, but I still decided not to get any work done today or yesterday.
D: Okay, and the fatigue, when did that start?
P: I think that started yesterday morning.
D: Okay. And sorry, back to the headache, have you tried anything for it?
P: I took Tylenol and Athol, but I guess it did get better for about an hour, a little bit, but it was back on again.
D: Okay, and could you describe, like, where you feel the headache?
P: Sure, yeah. So it's like right in the front, just kind of feels like a band, just like this pressure in the front of my head.
D: Okay. And has there been anything that's made the headache worse, like lights or sounds?
P: No, no, Like I said, it's like nothing like my usual migraine headaches.
D: Okay. And I mean that the Advil or Tylenol, it helps the symptoms for a brief period. But has there been anything else that's helped your headache?
P: No, not really.
D: Okay, and is there any particular time of the day that the headache's worse? Is in the morning time when you're first waking up or later in the day?
P: I don't think so.
D: Okay, and have you had any nausea or vomiting?
