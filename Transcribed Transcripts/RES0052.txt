P: She's been congested. She has this pink eye and she has a cough. Yeah.
D: Right. Conjunctivitis. Okay. So at this point, we will certainly run some investigations to look into what this could be. It sounds like a viral, infectious type of process, especially if it's involving the eyes, nose, and with a cough. So we will test for Covid for sure, but it could be something more common like the common cold. We just need to make sure that we're comprehensive with the testing.
P: That sounds great. Thank you.
