D: What brings you in?
P: Hi. I was just really worried. My son. Just yesterday night, I noticed that he was making these grunting noises. And I did notice that he was a bit warm yesterday as well. And today he just hasn't been himself. Just very, very irritable, crying a lot. So, yeah, I just got a bit worried.
D: Yeah, for sure.
P: What started first, I would say the. There was a little bit of coughing earlier, like yesterday. But then later on during the night, it kind of turned into this grunting noise. And he's kind of like his chest is moving a lot more when he's taking a breath in and all that.
D: Okay. Did you measure his temperature at home?
P: Yeah, so I think it was 38.5 degrees Celsius.
D: Okay. And did you do that oral or rectal or underarm pit?
P: I did it under the armpit.
D: Okay. Okay. So you mentioned that he's had a fever, he's been grunting, and he just seems a little bit more fussy. Is that right?
P: Yeah.
D: Okay. Is he coughing at all?
P: He was yesterday, but not really now.
D: Okay, and was it a dry cough?
P: I think so. Nothing really came out.
D: Okay, that's good. So no blood, no sputum?
P: No.
D: Okay. And did he seem wheezy?
P: No.
D: No. Okay, so there's no wheezing with the grunting?
P: Maybe a little bit, like, just a little bit of a noise, but it's mostly the grunting.
D: Okay. Has he had any weight loss?
P: No, not that I have really. We haven't really weighed him since his last appointment.
D: Okay, does he seem excessively tired or fatigued?
P: More so today? I would say he's like, earlier he was very fussy, but now he seems a bit more tired.
D: Okay. Any rashes that you've noticed? No, no. Okay. Any changes in his vision or hearing?
P: No, not that I can tell.
D: No. Okay, so he's responding to, like, sounds and he's still looking at you and things like that?
P: Yep.
D: Okay. Have you noticed a runny nose or stuffy nose?
P: No. Nothing like that?
D: No. Okay. And he said he hasn't had any, like, fainting spells?
P: No, I don't think so.
D: No. Okay. And how many wet diapers is he producing in a day now?
P: Probably five or six.
D: Five to six. Okay. Has that changed from before?
P: No, it's pretty much the same.
D: Okay, and any changes to his bowel movements?
P: No.
D: No. How about his urine?
P: No.
D: No. Okay. Okay. And you said he was fussy. Is he still eating and drinking? Okay.
P: No, today he's not really taking anything in, like, very fussy Very hard to feed him today.
D: Is he crying a lot?
P: Earlier today was crying a lot, but now it's calmed down and just, I guess, tired himself out.
D: Yeah. Okay. Alright. And is he an otherwise healthy child?
P: Yeah, he was. He was premature by three weeks. So other than that, like. And I remember when he was born, they did have earlier some issues with his oxygen not being high enough. And then they had to like keeping. Keep us in the hospital for a bit longer. Okay. But yeah, after that, like, there haven't really been too many concerns. Okay.
D: So he's hitting all the developmental milestones, like in terms of motor movements, speech, behavior, all of that.
P: Yeah, no issues there so far.
D: Okay, and how about medications? Is he on any? No, no medications. Okay. And is he up to date with all his immunizations?
P: Yeah, he had all his immunizations so far.
D: Okay, how about allergies? Does he have any?
P: Not that I know.
D: No. Okay. Any family history of lung or heart conditions?
P: No.
D: Okay. And does anyone at home smoke?
P: No, no one smokes.
D: Okay. Has he been in contact with anyone sick recently?
P: No, not that I know of. His older sister does go to school, though I don't know if she might have carried something home.
D: Okay, how old is she?
P: She's six years old.
D: Six. Okay. And is she healthy or is she having similar symptoms?
P: No, she's healthy. No, no symptoms.
D: Okay. Any travel recently? No, no.
P: Okay.
D: And who does he live with at home?
P: So his older sister, me and his mother.
D: Okay, Any reasons to believe, like you have old carpets, dust, mold, asbestos, pets, anything like that that could worsen his symptoms?
P: No, nothing like that.
D: Okay, so I think those are all the questions that I had for you. Did you have any questions or any concerns? Anything that I missed that you wanted to add?
P: No, I think that was all.
D: Okay, so for him, we'll do a Covid swab just to rule that out, because some of his symptoms do overlap with that, but it's really sounding like a picture of like community acquired pneumonia. So we'll do a couple of things for him. We can get his temperature, get his oxygen saturation right away. We'll get a chest X ray.
P: Or.
D: Do some blood work as well. And he might need to be admitted depending on the oxygen saturation and the fact that he's granting. So if he's admitted, we'll give him some extra oxygen and keep monitoring him and keep him hydrated. We'll also give him some antibiotics if it turns out he has pneumonia. Yeah. Does that sound okay?
P: That sounds good. Thank you.
D: Okay. Yeah. No worries.
