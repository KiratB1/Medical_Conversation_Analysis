D: What brings you in?
P: Hi. I've just had a runny nose and a cough for the past week.
D: Okay, so for the past week, you said, did the cough start first or the runny nose?
P: It started with the cough. I usually don't come in when I have symptoms like this, but I've just been. I just heard if someone passed away due to Covid, and I'm just like very scared and I just decided to come in.
D: Yeah, for sure. That's understandable. The cough, is it a dry cough or are you bringing up some phlegm?
P: It's mostly a dry cough.
D: Dry cough. Okay. Yeah. And is it persistent or does it come and go?
P: It comes and goes. It does get better when I take like over the counter medications for like the anti dust pills.
D: Okay. Yeah, yeah. And does anything make it worse, like the cold air or certain times of the day or like when you're laying down?
P: The cold air does make worse. Little bit at worse.
D: Okay. And have you experienced something like this in the past?

P: No, no, I don't think so.
D: No. Any wheeziness?
P: No. Chest pain? No.
D: How about a stuffy nose?
P: Yeah, I do have a stuffy nose.
D: Okay. When your nose does run, do you notice that it's like yellow in color or red? No. No, no. Okay, so it's clear.
P: It's clear.
D: Yeah. Okay. Any changes in your vision or hearing?
P: No.
D: Smell or taste?
P: I can't smell as much, but I think maybe it's just because my nose is so stuffy. But also that made me a little bit concerned about COVID But no problem with taste.
D: Okay, good. Any weight loss recently?
P: I've been trying to lose weight, but nothing unintentional, I guess.

P: Just, you know, just relax.
D: Okay, sure. Alcohol?
P: No.
D: No. Okay. And have you been around any sick people recently?
P: I went to. I went grocery shopping and someone near me was coughing. I was still, like, six. You know, I was away from them, but I don't. Like. Yeah, I don't know.
D: Yeah, for sure. I think that you're. It's fair that you're concerned about that. How about travel to anywhere?
P: No, I haven't traveled anywhere.
D: No. Okay. Okay. Well, those are all the questions I had for you. Did you have any questions of your own?
P: No.
D: No. Okay, so we'll do a Covid swab anyways today because some of your symptoms do overlap with that of COVID and you should hear back in about 24 to 48 hours. But in the meantime, you should self isolate for 14 days.
P: Sure.
D: But it. I think it does really sound like you have a common cold, so just like another viral illness. So just treat it supportively, you know, keep yourself hydrated. If you feel like you're getting a fever, take, like, Tylenol. If you have, like, pain, like a headache or like sinus pressure or something, you can take again an Advil or Tylenol. And if your symptoms worsen or if you have any neurological symptoms, then you should seek the ER right away.
P: Sure.
D: Yeah. Okay, Sounds good.
P: Great.
