P: Yeah. How do I get rid of this? It's really been bugging me.
D: Yeah, kind of. So just the stuffiness and the runny nose. It seems like it's most likely a viral infection like the common cold. It takes a few weeks for the symptoms to get relieved, but there's not much that we can do besides supportive care, so make sure you get you stay well hydrated. You can use over the counter medications like Tylenol cold to relieve some of your symptoms. But since right now we're in a pandemic, some of these symptoms can also be seen in COVID patients. So we will also get a swab done for you today and you should have the results back by 48 hours. And until then, we recommend that you stay isolated in your own home and not see anyone else. And then once the results come back, you'll get further instructions from public health.
P: Okay, that sounds great. Thank you.
D: You're welcome. Take care.
P: You too.
D: Bye.
