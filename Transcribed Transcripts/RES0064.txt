P: No, he hasn't told me anything about that.
D: Okay. Appetite changes?
P: Yeah, just with the trouble swallowing. I'm trying to make sure that he gets, like, liquids and more loose food over the last few days. He can tolerate, like, solid foods at all?
D: Yeah. How about weight loss over the past few Weeks?
P: No, not really. It's just been over the last few days that he hasn't been eating like himself.
D: Okay. All right. And has he been healthy otherwise?
P: Yeah, otherwise he's a very healthy child. We have rarely gone to a doctor for him before, so. Yeah, nothing. Nothing else with him.
D: Okay. Have you tried anything for his sore throat, anything over the counter?

P: No, not that I know.
D: Okay. Family history of lung conditions or heart conditions?
P: No, no longer heart conditions. His father does have diabetes, though.
D: Okay, how old was he when he was diagnosed with diabetes?
P: I think probably in his late 30s with type 2 diabetes.
D: Type 2. Okay. And any. Any sick contacts recently that he may have had?
P: I don't think at home at least, but maybe at school. Like, you never know who they're in contact with, so I'm wondering if he just picked it up somewhere from school.
D: Okay. Yeah, yeah.
P: They're all wearing masks right now, but I don't know if he picked something. Something up from his classmates.
D: Yeah, for sure. Okay. And then any travel to anywhere recently?
P: No, we've been at home. Haven't left even to go to, like, a different city. I've been in London the whole time.
D: Okay. Yeah. And who does he live with at home?
P: So he lives with myself and his dad.
D: Okay. Any siblings?
P: No, he's an only child.
D: Okay, Any reason to believe you have old carpets, mold, asbestos, anything that could be triggering his symptoms?
P: No, we don't have any pets. We don't have any. Like, it's a fairly new apartment, so I don't think any of that should be an issue.
D: Okay. Okay, good. Well, I think those are all the questions that I had for him. Anything that you wanted to add or anything that I missed today?
P: No, I think those were everything I wanted to talk about. I just was wondering if he needs to get tested or, like, if there's anything we can do today for him.
D: Yeah. So he does seem to be checking off some of the criteria for strep throat. So just to make sure, because he does have a scratch score of right now, at least three or four or maybe even five. Definitely over four, so we can prescribe him some antibiotics. But we will do a rapid strep test first in the clinic here today, just to rule that in or rule that out if it's positive, and I guess even if it isn't positive, because he checks off a lot of the boxes for strepto, we will give him a prescription for penicillin or amoxicillin for 10 days, and you can take that if his symptoms don't go away in a day or two, because his symptoms also overlap with COVID We'll do a swab for that as well, and you should hear back within 24, 48 hours, and you should isolate for 14 days. Okay? How does that sound?
P: Yeah, that sounds good.
D: Okay, great. Thank you.
P: Thank you.
