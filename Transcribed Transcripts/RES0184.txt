P: No, nothing else. I was just wondering what I could do to feel better or make this go away.
D: Yeah, certainly. So it sounds like you have the common cold or a viral illness, which it could be caused by something like adenovirus or. There are others as well. However, the symptoms do overlap with COVID as you can be nonspecific symptoms. So just having kind of just like a runny nose, like you do here. And so we will do a Covid swab and await those results, but in the meantime, it's mostly supportive care. So it means just trying to stay hydrated, stay rested, and just monitor your symptoms, because if things do get worse, it'll be important to go to the emergency room.
P: Okay.
D: All right, so we'll get the swab now and get that testing started.
P: Okay, that sounds great. Thank you.
D: Thank you.
