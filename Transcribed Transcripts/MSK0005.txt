D: What brings you in?
P: Hi. I've had this pain on the outside of my right elbow. Now, I first started noticing it several months ago, but recently it's just been more painful.
D: Okay, so you said several months ago. Did anything happen several months ago? Was there any sort of trigger trauma, anything like that to that area?
P: No, there wasn't any trauma or any triggers that I noticed. I was just feeling it a bit more at the end of work. Yeah, I was just feeling the pain a bit more at the end of work.
D: Okay. Does anything make it better or worse? The pain?
P: Yeah, really, If I'm just resting the elbow, it makes it better. And I've tried things like ibuprofen, which has helped with the pain. I'll do that for helping get through work sometimes if the pain's bad enough.
D: Right. Okay. And if you were to describe the quality of the pain, is it sharp, throbby, achy?
P: It's kind of. Well, it's achy. And then sometimes, depending on the movement it can get, it can be sharp as well.
D: It can be sharp. Okay. Okay. And what sorts of movements make it worse?
P: So, like, really, it's mostly movements at my wrist. If I'm bending my wrist down, I can feel it. Or if I'm having to pick things up or hold heavy objects at work, I do a lot of repetitive things that at work. On a line.
D: Okay. Okay. And 1 to 10. 10 being the worst pain you've ever felt. How bad is this pain?
P: It is about a four.
D: About a four. Okay. And have you ever experienced this type of pain before?

D: Okay. All right. And then do you have any sorts of aches or pains in any other joint or muscle groups?
P: No, it's just right there on the outside of my right elbow. And it's really annoying because I'm right handed as well, so. Yeah, it's causing problems there.
D: Right. And is the pain radiating upwards or downwards?
P: No, I kind of just feel it right over that one spot.
D: Okay. Any numbness or tingling in that arm?

D: Okay. And have you been around sick contacts recently?
P: No, I haven't been around anybody who's been sick.
D: Okay. Any recent travel?
P: Nope, I've been at home.
D: Okay. I think those are all the questions that I had for you. Did you have any questions of your own? For myself.
P: No. Well, I was just wondering what this pain could be in my elbow.
D: Yeah. So right now it seems like you may have a case of something called lateral epicondylitis. So it's also known as tennis elbow. And there are a lot of things that could kind of predispose you to this. So it could be like a repetitive strain at work and like continuous contraction of your wrist extensor muscle group there. So for this we basically recommend a couple of things to manage the pain. But first, like in terms of imaging, I don't think it is necessary because it doesn't seem like there was any trauma and I'm not too worried about any fractures. So to help you treat this, we recommend some activity modifications. So at work not doing things that are too repetitive, especially if it's using those extensor forearm muscles. And then you can use some use a compression sleeve as well. Continue taking Tylenol or NSAIDs for the pain. And really important is physical therapy to increase mobility and strength in that arm. And as well, you can apply things like ice to it for, like, the pain and swelling, if you see any. Yeah. So it should resolve in about six months to two years at most. But normally it does go in a couple months with some physical therapy and the compression and splints, if you choose to do that. How does that sound?
P: Yeah, that sounds good. Thank you.
D: Yeah, no worries.
