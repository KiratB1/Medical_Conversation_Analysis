D: Yeah. So we can definitely talk more about alcohol usage. Definitely. Especially when there's people going through stressful times. There can be increases in substance use, including alcohol. So we definitely have a lot of resources that we can discuss today if you would like.
P: Yeah, I would really like that. Thank you.
D: Welcome. But those are all the questions I had for today. We'll definitely do, like a physical examination, but it seems you've just been having a cough for the last two weeks.
P: Yeah.
D: Without any other symptoms. Okay. So do you have any questions at all for me?
P: No.
D: So what we'll do is since you have this cough for the last two weeks we definitely want to do Covid swab just in case working from home. But if there was any potential contact they usually comes back in 24 to 48 hours. Okay. Other than that, sometimes with history of smoking you can have something called copd. We can like after doing the physical examinations and everything we can potentially discuss doing pulmonary function test as well. And yeah, other than that it can also just be like a dry cough. Can be just a viral upper respiratory tract infection that takes two or more weeks to resolve. In that case we wouldn't really.
P: Sure.
D: Yes, we'll do the physical examination and then go from there.
P: Sounds great.
D: All right. Taking care of.
