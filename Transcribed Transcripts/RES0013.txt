P: Hi, I'm Rob. And I just feel like I can't catch my breath.
D: Okay. How old are you, rob?
P: I'm. I'm 50. I'm gonna be 50 soon.
D: Okay. Okay. When did this start?
P: Well, like, last night, I kind of had, like, an ache on my chest. Kind of like here, like, on the left. I just. I didn't do anything really, last night. And, you know, I just went to sleep and got to sleep fine. Like, I just thought maybe I pulled a muscle on this side. Then I woke up, and I was, like, walking up the stairs, and I, like, kind of having a hard time breathing, and I took some Tylenol. I don't. Like, it didn't really do anything. And then it just got worse. And then a few hours ago, I was like, I could barely walk. And if I'm breathing deep, it's like, it just hurts. And, yeah, I feel like I can't, like, catch my breath. Like, I can't get a good. Like a good breath in.
D: Okay. So I just want to state at this point, I would do ABCs. Like, I would do the vitals, make sure you're stable, and then do airway, breathing, circulation. If you weren't before. I continue with the history. Okay, so. Okay, so that's how it started. Are you having any chest pain at all associated with that?
P: Like, when I breathe in, I get like, an. It's like an ache. And then if I breathe really deep, it feels like a little sharp.
D: Okay.
P: Yeah. I've never had anything like this before.
D: No. Okay, that was going to be my next question. On a scale of 1 to 10, how severe is your shortness of breath? 10 being the worst?
P: I don't know. I can breathe right now. I can't get, like, a deep breath. Like, does it.
D: Oh, sorry. Go ahead.
P: Maybe, like, you know, a five or six.
D: Okay. Okay. Does it hurt when you take a deep breath in? Yeah, yeah, yeah.
P: It's like a. It's, like, sharp.
D: Okay, so sounds like you're having some pleuritic chest pain. Do you have any coughing associated with that?
P: No.
D: No, no. You're not coughing up any blood?
P: No.
D: Any swelling in your legs?
P: I don't think so, no.
D: Okay, how about on exertion? Like when you walk or run or, you know, does it hurt more or does. I mean. Sorry. Does your shortness of breath get worse?
P: Oh, yeah, it was like going up the stairs. They barely breathed after.
D: Okay, how about when you're laying down?
P: I don't. No, I don't think that's any Different?
D: No. Okay.
P: I slept fine last night. I got up, and when I went up the stairs, I was like, holy.
D: Okay, how about wheezing? Are you experiencing any wheezing?
P: I don't think so.
D: Okay, how about fevers or chills?
P: No, not that I've noticed.
D: No. Okay. Any abdominal pain?
P: No, no, it's like. It aches kind of, but. Yeah, it's all up here and, like, kind of in my back a little bit.
D: Okay. And do you think anything triggered this?
P: I don't know.
D: No. Okay. And you said this has never happened to you before, right? Right.
P: Yeah, I.
D: Does it get better with you sitting forward?
P: I don't know. Like, I feel like that it's still kind of aching. Like, it doesn't. It's not really, like, changing very much.
D: Okay. Okay. Okay. Any changes in your vision, hearing or smell? No, no. Any rashes?
P: No, no.
D: Weight loss?
P: I mean, I've been trying to lose weight.
D: Okay.
P: They told me a year ago I have, like, high blood pressure, so I've been cutting out salt and trying to walk more.
D: Okay. Okay, good.
P: So I've lost, like, Â£15, but, like, not. I've been trying to.
D: Okay. Okay. Fifteen pounds. That's good. Are you experiencing any dizziness or are you feeling faint?
P: No, just, like. I can't get, like, a good grip.
D: Okay. And are you otherwise healthy? You mentioned you have high blood pressure. Anything else?
P: No, that's. That's like it. I've never had any, like, chest problems.
D: Okay. Have you had any investigations done for your chest? Like pulmonary function tests, ECGs, chest X rays?
P: No, they just put the thing on my arm. My doctor's office, and said that it was high, so they said to, you know, eat better. And I didn't. I didn't want to start any drugs, so I didn't do anything. I've been fine ever since.
D: Okay. So you're not on any medications?
P: No, just. Yeah, no, that's it. I mean, I, you know, sometimes take, like, a Tylenol. Not feeling well, but.
D: Okay. And do you smoke?
P: I smoke a little bit. Maybe like a pack a week.
D: A pack a week. Okay. For how long?
P: Since college.
D: Okay. Okay. Do you smoke marijuana?
P: No. No. And I. I smoke. I'm trying to smoke less, you know, since they told me I have the high blood pressure. So I. I used to smoke a little more, but this is. This is less, but not since I've been having trouble breathing.
D: Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Any other recreational drugs?
P: No. No.
D: No. Okay. How about alcohol? Do you drink alcohol?
P: Oh, like, maybe a Beer on the weekend.
D: Okay. And are you up to date with all your immunizations?
P: I think I got all the ones when I was, like, a kid. What else should I have?
D: Okay, so, like, the flu vaccine? Every year.
P: Oh, I get that. Like, my wife. My wife makes me get that.
D: Okay, that's good. Any family history of lung or heart disease?
P: Like, my. My mom and dad have a high blood pressure to. So it wasn't surprised when I heard that I did.
D: Okay. Okay. Okay. So, Rob, is there anything that you wanted to tell me that I haven't asked you already today?
P: I'm really nervous because I haven't felt anything like this before. Like, it's scary. Like, do you think it's, like, cancer or something? Like, I don't. I don't really know.
D: I mean, it's hard to tell right now what it is. It sounds like it's. It started pretty suddenly. Like, it started a day ago. Correct. Yeah. So it's unlikely that cancer would present itself like this so acutely, you know, but it could. It could be a number of things. Like, it could be something like a pulmonary embolism. But you said you don't have any swelling. But you did say you have some chest pain when you're breathing in pretty. When you take a deep breath in. So, I mean, that's a possibility. It doesn't sound like it's an infection because you don't have a fever or chills or any. Any other symptom, really. And you mentioned there weren't any triggers, like, no trauma to the area. And then other things could be like copd, because you. Which is chronic obstructive pulmonary disease because you have been smoking since college, and that's basically just inflammation in your lungs that causes your airways to narrow, and so you may have a hard time breathing. So for all of these things, we first start by doing some blood work, and then we'll do some imaging, like a chest X ray, and then a pulmonary function test, if indicated. And so that will give us a better idea of what you have and how we can best help you. Does that sound good?
P: Yeah. Yeah. I just really want to get a good breath, so. Yeah, whatever we can do.
D: Yeah, for sure. And then in the meantime, we'll keep monitoring you to make sure your vitals are okay. And if we need to give you oxygen, we will.
P: That'd be great.
D: Okay. Thank you.
