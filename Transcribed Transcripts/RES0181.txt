P: No.
D: Okay. Have you been sexually active before?
P: No.
D: Okay, so. Okay, so that was all the questions that I wanted to ask. Was there anything else that you wanted to mention today?
P: No, I don't think so. When you asked me if my neck was swollen. My neck's not swollen, but I feel like inside the back of my throat, my tonsils feel a little bit swollen. Swollen.
D: Okay. Have you looked. Does it look like you have, like, redness in the back of your back of your mouth?
P: Yeah, it looks pretty red and angry.
D: Okay. And it's sore?
P: Yeah.
D: Okay, so just to kind of summarize, this, sounds like the symptoms you've been having so the sore throat, like the redness and swelling of the. The tonsils in the back of your mouth, as well as a fever and being pretty tired over these last few days.
P: Yeah.
D: Okay.
P: Yeah.
D: All right. So it's sounding like most likely this would be strep throat or group A strep pharyngitis with. Because you have no cough and with the high fever and swelling that you've in redness that you notice in the back of your mouth. And so we'll do a rapid strep antigen test, and it will require just a throat swab to help to see. To detect for that, however, with. Yeah, I guess that's what. Yeah, we'll start with that now. And could potentially be something like a viral illness, but that's lower on the differential than the bacterial infection is right now. And because of COVID we'll do a swab as well, because people can get fever and sore throat with COVID as well. So just to make sure that we're being comprehensive.
P: Okay, that sounds good. Thank you so much.
D: Thank you.
