D: What brings you in today?
P: So, just for the past, like, three days, I've been coughing. I don't feel particularly sick, just kind of dry, like, annoying cough that won't go away. And then today I took my temp and it was pretty high. It was like 99.9. I didn't really take it the other days, so. Yeah, so I just thought I better come and get it checked out because I. I am on, like a biologic medication for my Crohn's disease.
D: Okay. Yeah, yeah. Thank you for coming in. I think it's good that you are getting this checked out as early as possible. So just to rewind a little bit, when did your dry cough start?
P: Like, three days ago.
D: Three days ago. Okay. And when did your fever start?
P: So I didn't take my temp, but like the other days. But, like, for sure this morning.
D: Okay. Okay. So the cough, is it always a dry cough or do you sometimes bring up sputum or blood?
P: Yeah, it's always a dry cough. It's really just annoying, I think.
D: Yeah. Yeah. Do you feel wheezy at all?
P: No.
D: No wheeziness. Okay. How about short of breath?
P: No.
D: No. Okay. Any chest pain?
P: No.
D: No. Do you ever feel like your heart is racing?
P: No, I can't say that I do.
D: Okay. Any swelling in your limbs?
P: No.
D: Okay. How about a sore throat?
P: No.
D: No sore throat. Okay. Any issues with taste or smell?
P: No.

P: Maybe a bit of a runny nose?
D: Okay. Any issues with vision or hearing?
P: No.
D: Okay. How about fevers or chills?
P: No.
D: No. Or.
P: Sorry, elude the fever. I mean, I. I took my temper. It was high. I guess I felt hot, but I didn't. There are no chills.
D: Okay. Okay. How about weight loss? Oh, that's okay. How about weight loss?

D: Okay. Any changes in your hair, nails or skin? Like rashes?
P: No.

P: No.
D: Nausea or vomiting?
P: Nope.
D: Changes in your bowel habits?
P: Well, like I said, I have Crohn's disease. I'm not like in a flare right now or anything, so I'll say no. But, like, my baseline is not, like, totally normal.
D: Okay. Yeah, that makes sense. All right. Any changes in your urine?
P: No.
D: No changes in urine. How about dizziness or fainting spells?
P: No.
D: Any confusion or memory loss?
P: No.
D: Okay. And are you otherwise healthy? I know you mentioned you have Crohn's disease. Do you have any other long standing medical conditions?
P: Not really. Just that and eczema.
D: Eczema okay.
P: It can sometimes get pretty bad. Like, I don't really have any right now, but I really stay on top of it with, like, my moisturizers. And, like, I always have, like, a hydrocortisone cream on hand just in case.
D: Yeah, for sure. How long have you had eczema for?
P: Oh, like, when I started when I was, like, a kid, and then I feel like when I was a teenager, I didn't really. And then kind of as an adult, I really have to take care of it or else it gets bad.
D: Okay. Okay. Have you ever been hospitalized or have you had any surgeries in the past?
P: Like, when I was first diagnosed with Crohn's maybe 20 years ago, when I was, like, 20, I was in the hospital for a little bit because I was really dehydrated, and I couldn't really. Like, I just. Yeah, I wasn't feeling well at that time, but since then, I've been pretty on top of it.
D: Okay, that's good to hear. You mentioned you're on biologics for Crohn's disease. Are there any other medications that you're on?
P: Just, like, hydrocortisone cream, like, on occasion.
D: Right. Okay. Okay. And do you have any allergies?
P: Like, I have some seasonal allergies. Like, it's ragweed, which is not right. Now is not the time for it. And, like, cats and dogs.
D: Okay. Okay.
P: Like, just environmental. It's not like. Not like, the really dangerous allergies, you know?
D: Right. Okay. How about immunizations? Are you up to date?
P: I think so.
D: All right. And in terms of family history, are there any lung conditions or heart conditions?
P: Like, my dad had high blood pressure, but other than that, I don't think there was anything that stood out.
D: Okay, how about your smoking history? Do you smoke at all?
P: Like, I did for a couple years when I was, like, 18, and. And then I haven't ever since.
D: Okay, how about marijuana?
P: No.
D: No marijuana. Okay, how about other recreational drugs?
P: No.
D: No. Okay. Alcohol.
P: Like, I might have, like, a couple beers on the weekend.
D: Okay, sure, sure. And where do you live right now?
P: So I live in a townhouse in London. Here I live alone, but I have my kids every. I have my kids, like, Wednesdays and Thursdays and then every other weekend.
D: Okay. Any concerns for old carpets, mold, asbestos, anything like that in the home?
P: No, it's, like, a pretty new build.
D: Okay. And have you been around, any sick contacts recently?
P: I mean, my kids just left this weekend. Those are the only people I've been around. I can. Maybe I should have asked them before coming here if they, like, knew if they had seen anyone, but they were fine over the weekend.
D: Okay. And have you traveled to anywhere recently?
P: No.
D: No. Okay. Those were all the questions that I had today. Was there anything else that you wanted to add? Anything that I missed, perhaps?
P: Oh, I don't think so. I think that's it.
D: Okay.
P: You know, I hope. I hope. I just wanted to come in case it was something bad, just because I. You know, I have those other health problems. I just want to make sure that.
D: Yeah, yeah, yeah, for sure. And I think it's a good thing that you came in. So thank you. Right now, I guess top on the list of things that you could possibly have is Covid. So we'll get you tested for that. We'll get you a swab, and you should have the results of that swab in about 24 to 48 hours. You should isolate for 14 days, regardless, though, because your symptoms do overlap with symptoms of COVID and that includes isolating from your children as well. And. Yeah, and if it's not Covid, it could be another viral illness that's going around at this time of year. Just. So just make sure you're staying hydrated, you're eating nutritious foods and getting good sleep. If your symptoms do become worse, and if they become severe, like you have a really high temperature, you have trouble breathing, or you have any neurological symptoms like seizures or fainting spells, please do go to the ER and seek help. How does that sound?
P: Yeah, I guess that sounds good. Guess that's how it's got to be, right?
D: Yeah, unfortunately. Well, thank you again.
P: Thank you. Have a good day.
D: You, too.
