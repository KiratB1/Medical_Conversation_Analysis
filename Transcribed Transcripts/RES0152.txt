D: How may I help you?
P: Hi. Nice to meet you. I've just been experiencing a cough for the last few weeks, and I also recently started noticing that I'm coughing up some blood as well. Like it's mixed into like, sputum.
D: I see. All right, so you said a few weeks with the cough. Is this more than three weeks, more than four weeks or a few months? Almost.
P: I would say almost like three weeks now.
D: Okay. When the cough started, were you bringing up. Were you bringing up sputum or phlegm at that time?
P: Yeah, initially it was just like kind of white to sometimes yellowish phlegm. But now over the last week, I've been also noticing some blood in it as well.
D: Okay, and how much blood have you been bringing up? Just trying to think maybe teaspoon sizes, if you can.
P: Yeah, I would say maybe half a teaspoon break each time.
D: Okay, and have you been having any shortness of breath?
P: No, I don't think so, but kind of like I do feel some discomfort in my chest. Like I just associated that with the cough.
D: I see. Have you had any chest pain?

P: Yeah, I would say like a few times this week I've also felt like, hot.
D: All right, have you had any, like, night sweats?
P: Now that you mentioned it, like, I would say two days out of the last week I've had night sweats where my sheets were kind of just drenched when I. And then I woke up noticing that.

P: Yeah, currently I'm living just in. It's kind of like a home with just. I don't really know the people too well. Just kind of like a home where a bunch of guys are just living and working separately. I just actually recently moved here from the Philippines six months ago.
D: I see. Okay. Do you interact with many of the people in the house? And has anybody else been sick?
P: I don't know if anyone else has been sick. I haven't really noticed it. I don't really see them too much.
D: Okay. And six months ago, prior to. I am. Yeah. Coming from the Philippines, was anybody sick there or did you hear of anybody that you spent time with having tuberculosis?

D: Okay, So I think that's everything I wanted to ask on history today. So it sounds like you've been having this cough that's been going on for just over three weeks now. And starting with some whitish clear sputum. And more recently, you've started to be coughing up some blood as well. And you've also been really fatigued. And I've had some malaise over the last several weeks. And any other symptoms? Oh, and also, yeah, you've had some night sweats, chills, and been feeling feverish as well. So we'll certainly check a temperature today, too. Is there anything I missed?
P: No, I think that that sounds great. Thank you so much.
D: Okay, so we'll get the testing started.
P: For.
D: The investigations, and, yeah, if at any point symptoms get worse, we'll reevaluate.
P: Yeah, sounds good. Thank you so much.
