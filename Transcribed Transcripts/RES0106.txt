D: Okay. Okay, good. So those were all the questions that I had for you today. Did you have any questions of your own?
P: No, I was just worried. This cough isn't serious, right? You don't think I have Covid?
D: So, because your symptoms do overlap with that of COVID we're gonna get a swab on you. Done. And you should get those results in about 24 to 48 hours. And if it's positive, public health will be in touch to do some contact tracing. In the meantime, because you have a cough, it is recommended that you isolate for 14 days. And if it's not Covid, it's probably something like acute bronchitis or some other viral infection that's going around at this time of year. So for that, we can. You can just treat it with, like, supportive treatments, you know, like staying hydrated, good nutrition, good sleep. And just keep an eye on your symptoms if they become worse or really severe, like you're having neurological symptoms, and just seek help from the ER for sure.
P: Thank you.
D: Yeah. Take care.
