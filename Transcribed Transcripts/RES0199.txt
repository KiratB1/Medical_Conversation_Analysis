D: What brings you in?
P: Hi. I just came in today. I've been having. Just been feeling really sick over the last three or four days. It started with just like a headache and cough four days ago, and then I started getting some nausea and vomiting a few days back, as well as diarrhea.
D: Okay, so the headache and cough started first, you said, right?
P: Yes.
D: Okay, let's talk about the headache first. That came on four days ago. Has it been persistent or does it come and go?
P: It's been pretty persistent, besides, when I take some Tylenol.
D: Okay. And does anything make it better or worse?
P: Just the Tylenol. Nothing. Really? Yeah, it's pretty constant.
D: Okay, and how about. Sorry, where exactly is it? Is it on? Is it like at the top of your head, temples, forehead?
P: It's kind of like my forehead and the top of my head on both sides.
D: Okay, and does it radiate to your neck or anywhere else?
P: No, I think it's. It doesn't go to my neck or anywhere else.
D: Okay, and do you have neck stiffness or neck pain with that?
P: No, not really.
D: And 1 to 10, 10 being the worst pain you've ever had? How bad is it.
P: The headache? Probably like seven.
D: Okay, and timeline wise, has it gotten worse over the past four days?
P: It's kind of stayed around the same, actually.
D: Okay. Okay. And have you ever had a headache like this in the past?
P: Not really. I don't really get too many headaches.
D: Okay, so this is new. All right, and let's go on to the cough. The cough started around the same time you said. Has that gotten better or worse over the past four days?
P: The cough is around the same as well.
D: Okay, and is it a dry cough or are you breaking up any phlegm?
P: It's mostly a dry cough.

P: No, I haven't.
D: No. Any fevers or chills? No, no. Okay, and how about fatigue?
P: I guess just a little bit tired over the last few days, but I don't know if that's just from the diarrhea and just being sick.
D: Okay, and how about rashes?
P: No.

P: No, nothing like that.
D: How about a stuffy or runny nose?

D: Okay. And where do you currently live?
P: I live just in an apartment, just in the city, so yeah, just by myself though.
D: Okay. Any like old carpets, dust, mold, asbestos, pets, anything that could be triggering your symptoms?
P: No, not really.
D: Okay, and have you been in contact with anyone sick recently?
P: No, I've been kind of at home. The only places I maybe have been in contact with someone is maybe at work in like the lunchroom and things like that.
D: Okay. Okay. And sorry, where do you work?
P: I work at a car dealership.
D: Okay. Okay. Any travel recently?
P: No.
D: Okay. Has anyone at your work been sick as well?
P: No, I haven't really noticed anyone being sick.
D: Okay. Okay. Well, those were all the questions that I had for you. Did you have any questions of your own for me?
P: No, I was just wondering what this can be.
D: Yeah. So the first thing we want to rule out is Covid, because a lot of your symptoms overlap with those of COVID So we'll take a swab, and you should get those results in about 24 to 48 hours. In the meantime, you should isolate for 14 days. And if your results are positive, Public Health will be in touch with you to do some contact tracing. But if it's not Covid, it could be another viral illness that's going around this time of year that could be causing similar symptoms as well. But either way, the management kind of is supportive. So making sure you're well hydrated, eating nutritious foods, sleeping well, taking antipyretics like Tylenol for fevers, if you get any. And you can also take Tylenol or NSAIDs for muscle ache, joint pains, anything like that. Does that sound okay?
P: Yeah, that sounds good. Thank you.
D: Okay, great. No problem.
