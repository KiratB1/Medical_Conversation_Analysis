P: No. Well, it kind of happens all throughout the day. Yeah. No, it hasn't woke me up at night.

P: I can't think of anything really. It just kind of comes on like throughout the day, spontaneously.
D: Have you taken any medications to help with your symptoms?
P: Yeah, some over the counter cold medicines. I tried to make Tylenol cold and sinus or something like that anyway, and it did help me sleep a little bit with the headache and just haven't been feeling very good. Did help with that.

P: I kind of feel it all over. It's like a band. Feels like it's just around my head.
D: And squeezing and how, like if you had to give it a number from 1 to 10, what number would you give it? With 10 being the worst headache ever.
P: I would say maybe a five.
D: Okay. And you mentioned that the Tylenol helped.
P: It did, yeah. Probably took it down to a two or a three. Maybe the headache didn't go away entirely. It was sort of still there, but did help.
D: Have you had any other symptoms? Have you had confusion or is it any fuzziness or any flu like symptoms?

D: Okay. Have you had any exposures to anyone who could potentially be sick.
P: Without. Well, yeah, a couple or last weekend actually, there was a family party that we went to. It was outside, but it. Yeah, there was people around. There's nobody that was sick that I'm aware of.
D: Okay. And any. Have you traveled anywhere outside the province?
P: No, Been besides that. The family party last weekend, but I mean, that was just here in town, so. Yeah, it was. It's close by.
D: Okay. I guess I forgot to ask about a symptom. Have you felt that you've lost your sense of smell or sense of taste? Has it just been different?
P: Yeah, my sense of. Actually, you mentioned it. My sense of smell has been different, which is kind of weird because I don't have a runny nose or I don't feel congested or anything, so. Yeah, but my taste has been okay.
D: Okay, good. Well, that's all the questions I had for you. Given that your symptoms sort of sound like you may have a viral or bacterial infection, and seeing that you were. You had some exposure to other people even though they weren't sick, it could. It could be that they. They had some sort of an illness that they could transmit, that they weren't just showing symptoms at the time. We will get a Covid swab done just to make sure that that's not what's happening. It could be that, and I'll recommend that you continue to, you know, take Tylenol and rest and take care of yourself. And if your symptoms worsen or stay the same for a long period of time, definitely come back or call public health to get some guidance and try to stay away from others and self isolate for the next couple of days or at least until your Covid swabs back or your symptoms improve or the next 14 days. So that's all I have for you today. Do you have any questions for me?
P: No, that sounds really good. Thank you.
