D: I hear that you have been having some coughing, so I'm just gonna chat with you for a bit, get an idea of how things are going. We'll have a listen to your lungs and your heart, and then I will go grab the doctor that's working today and we'll talk about it, and then we'll come back and let you know what the next steps are gonna be. Does that sound good to you?
P: Yeah, that sounds great. Thank you.
D: Okay. So can you tell me about what brought you in today? Yeah.
P: I've had this cough for the past four or five days, and it doesn't seem to be going away or getting better, so I thought I should get it checked out.

P: No.
D: Do you see your family doctor for anything? Any health problems?
P: No, no.
D: Do you take any medicines? This might be a tricky one to answer, so mom can definitely help us. Do you have any family history of respiratory problems?
P: His grandparents had asthma, but he's been worked up for that. And he doesn't get short of breath or wheezy or anything like that with. Even with physical activity. So. Yeah, so he doesn't have that. Pardon me?

P: Nope. No.
D: Okay. And what do you like to do for fun?
P: I like playing with my friends. I like playing video games.
D: What's your favorite game?
P: I'm playing roller coaster tycoon.
D: Oh, cool. That sounds like fun. Okay, well, hopefully we can get you back to feeling healthy so you can continue to play lots of rollercoaster tycoon. I want to go get the doctor that I'm working with. I'm wondering if he might want to do a chest X ray and get a better look at what's going on there. Have you ever had an X ray before?
P: I don't think so, no.
D: Do you know what an X ray is?
P: A little bit, yeah.
D: Yeah. It's like taking pictures of your body on the inside. It's pretty cool. So it gives us an idea of what's going on on the inside. Also, this really, this part is kind of not so much fun, but I think we should probably do a Covid swab because we're doing that with anyone that comes in with these symptoms lately, and that's not a lot of fun. We gotta stick something up your nose. But I think that you're really brave and I think that you'll be just fine with it. Okay.
P: Okay.
D: So we're gonna arrange for these things and then I will come back with the doctor that I'm working with and we'll kind of talk about where to go from here.
P: Okay, that sounds good.
D: Okay, well, thank you guys for chatting with me.
P: Yeah, thank you.
D: Thanks.
