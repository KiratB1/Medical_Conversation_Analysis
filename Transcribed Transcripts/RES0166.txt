D: Okay. All right, so those are all the questions I had for you today. We'll do a full physical examination next. Do you have any questions or concerns?
P: No.
D: Okay. So, yeah, right now, one of the main things we want to rule out, especially since you had the sudden shortness of breath today after a history of just recent discharge and hip fracture or injury, and you're immobilized, we need to make sure you haven't developed a clot that has traveled to your lungs. So we'll do a full physical examination and get some blood work done initially, and then see if you require any medications for. If you need thrombolysis for. To break up the clot. And we might do some imaging as well. So, yeah, we'll just start with that, and then we'll go from there.
P: Sure.
D: So you'll be in here for a few hours until we get all those things done and see if you need any admission at all to the hospital.
P: Sure.
D: Okay. All right.
P: Thank you.
D: Welcome. Take care.
