D: What brings you in here today?
P: I've had this pain in my back that's kind of like in my lower back in my buttocks, and it's now radiating down to my right leg. I've had this for a while now, but it's getting worse, and I just want to come get it checked out.
D: Okay, and how long have you had this pain for?
P: I'd say about a month.
D: Okay, and has it gone worse at all? Like, did you have the it radiating to your leg before, or is that something that happened after?
P: That's something that happened after that happens. That. That's been going on for the past week.
D: Okay. And is this pain constant or does it come and go?
P: It's pretty much always there, but certain things can make it worse. Like if I'm walking or doing certain activities, it can make it worse.
D: Okay, and did you have any back pain before this month?
P: No, not. I mean, no, not really.
D: Okay, and what kind of pain would you say it is? Is it like a sharp, stabbing pain or is it more so and all aching pain?
P: Usually, or. Well, before it was like a mild achy pain, but now it can be. It's sharp and it feels like a burning sensation.
D: Okay, burning sensation. Where would you say that burning sensation is?
P: It's like down my buttocks to the right leg.
D: Okay, and do you feel any kind of numbness or tingling with it?
P: A little. A little bit of tingling? Yeah, a little bit of tingling.
D: Okay, and how would you rate the pain from a scale of 0 to 10, 10 being the worst pain you've had in your life?
P: So usually it's about like a 5 to 6 out of 10. But when it gets bad and it's sharp, I'd give it an 8 out of 10.
D: Okay. And are there any kind of motions or positions that cause you more pain?
P: Yeah, so I'd say, like, just any sort of physical activity. Like, if I'm on my feet a lot, it hurts. Yeah, that's pretty much the only thing that I can think of right now.
D: Okay, and did anything happen one month ago or before this pain started? Like, any injuries or falls that might have caused this pain?
P: I know, like a long time ago, like maybe six, seven years ago, I injured my back at work, but I just did some conservative treatments for that, and it went away.
D: Okay. And was it your lower back?
P: Yes.
D: Okay. And what do you do for work?
P: I used to work on an assembly line. So I used to, like, carry heavy objects and things like that, like car parts.
D: Okay. And do you still work There?
P: No, I don't.
D: Okay. When did you stop working there?
P: About three years back.
D: Okay. And is there any other work you do currently?
P: I work from home now. I do daycare at home.
D: Okay. Okay. And just getting back to the pain. So it's kind of in your lower back, your buttocks, and then it goes to your right upper leg. Does it move anywhere else besides that, or those are the regions that it stays in?
P: No, those are kind of the only regions that I'm experiencing it right now.
D: Okay. And do you get more pain leaning, bending forward, or would you say extending your back?
P: I would say extending my back hurts more.
D: Okay. And do you get pain with sitting down?
P: Sometimes.
D: Okay. How about lying down?
P: Lying down? I guess it depends on the position. If I am straight on my back, it's not too bad, but if I'm hunched over or something like that, it hurts.
D: Okay, I see. Okay. And have you tried any medications over the counter, any painkillers that have helped?
P: I tried some ibuprofen and some topical like ointments, but it helps temporarily and then the pain comes back.

D: Okay. And has that been working for you at all?
P: A little bit, I think.
D: Okay. Okay. So those are some of the questions I had, and I'm just gonna ask a few questions about just examining the areas that are giving you trouble. So along your back, if you were to press down from the middle to your lower back, any kind of pain when you press down?
P: Lower back, yes.
D: Okay, so what kind of pain? Is it, like, sharp or is it kind of a dull, aching pain?
P: When I press down, it feels sharp.
D: Okay, and do you. Have you noticed any kind of swelling in your legs or near the areas where you have pain? Swelling or redness or any warmth?
P: It seems to, actually. No, it's not warm.
D: Okay. And in terms of just movement, are you able to bend down?
P: I can bend down. It's just hard for me to get back up.
D: Okay, I see. And how about, like, bend sideways?
P: I can do that.
D: Okay. And how about if you're laying flat, are you able to raise your legs without bending your knees?
P: I can do that, yeah. Actually, no, I can't. Sorry. That hurts.
D: So your right leg hurts when you do that?
P: Yeah.
D: Okay. And other than that, like, when you. When you do any of those movements, can you. Do you get, like that tingling again?
P: Yeah, it does, yeah.
D: Okay. All right. And when you stand up and walk, how would you describe. Are you having any kind of limping at all?
P: A little bit of limp, yeah. I'm putting more weight on the left leg.
D: Okay. All right. So, yeah, those are just some of the questions I had for you today. Do you have any questions at all?
P: No. What can I do about this back pain and how long do you think I'll have it for?
D: Yeah. So it's been happening for one month. Right. And you're getting some symptoms in your lower leg. So normally we would wait before we do any kind of diagnostic imaging. But since you're also having these other symptoms we're worrying about, sometimes lower back pain can lead to something called sciatica. It's just when one of the nerves gets pinched and then that's why you're getting the tingling around your right upper leg. So what we can do is we can do, if you haven't had an X ray, we can do an X ray of your lower back and then we can also do an mri. And based on what results come back at the same time, I will give you some information about some anti inflammatory medications you can take to help relieve some of your pain. But other than that, I will also refer you to some physiotherapy that will help you do some exercises at home and just ways to protect your back as well as strengthen some of your muscles to help deal with some of that pain. Yeah. So we'll get the results back and then we'll go from there.
P: Okay, Sounds good. Thank you.
D: You're welcome. Take care.
