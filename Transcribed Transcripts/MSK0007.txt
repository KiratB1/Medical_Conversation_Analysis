D: How may I help you?
P: Hi. Yeah, so I've had this pain in my left elbow for a couple of weeks now, and it's not getting any better, so I'm just here to kind of figure out what it is.
D: Okay. All right. Are you feeling this pain on the lateral side of the elbow or on the medial side of the elbow?
P: It's on the medial side.
D: Okay. And. Sorry, when did this pain exactly start?
P: So it's been ongoing for, like, the past three months, but it's gotten worse over the last. I'd say three weeks.
D: Okay. And has the pain been getting worse, any better?

D: Okay. Just on the medial side of the left elbow?
P: Yeah.
D: Okay. And is there anything that you've done to help make the pain go away or any alleviating factors?

D: Okay, so it's a movement. Okay. And straightening the elbow?
P: Yeah.
D: Okay. And what is the severity of the pain on a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being the worst pain you've ever felt?

D: And what do you do?
P: I work on the assembly line for Chrysler.

P: I do.
D: Okay, and do you notice this pain after. More so after a shift or after. After a long day?
P: Yes, definitely.
D: Okay, and what types of hobbies do you have? Like, do you play golf or tennis or any kind of, like, sports, I guess?
P: Yeah, I used to play golf before this pain in my arm, in my elbow. So I haven't played it in the past, like, six months.
D: Okay. Okay. And do you smoke cigarettes?

P: No.
D: Any musculoskeletal or neurological diseases?
P: No.
D: Okay, how about any autoimmune diseases like thyroid disease or diabetes?
P: No.
D: Okay. And so next, I just wanted to walk through a physical exam. So when you look at the elbow yourself, do you see any swelling or redness?
P: No.
D: Okay, does it look like there is any muscle atrophy either in the forearm or the biceps or triceps?
P: No.
D: Okay. And how about any misalignment or joint deformity?
P: No, I don't see any of that.
D: Okay. And are there any scars?
P: No.
D: Okay. And when you press on the medial part of the elbow do you feel pain?
P: I do.
D: How about over the olecranon or the. Yeah. Any pain over the olecranon?
P: A little bit.
D: Okay. And is there any pain over the lateral part of the elbow?
P: No.
D: Okay. And any pain over the forearm or biceps or triceps muscles?
P: No.
D: Feel like it's hot?
P: No.
D: Okay. And any pain with shoulder or elbow movements?
P: No.
D: Okay.
P: Actually, sorry. With the elbow, when I straighten it out all the way, it hurts a little bit.
D: Okay. When you're straightening it out all the way. Okay. But no pain with shoulder movements and full range of motion?
P: No. No pain with shoulder.
D: Okay. And how about pain with pronation and supination?
P: With pronation, it hurts.
D: Okay. At the medial side?
P: Yes.
D: Okay. And how about with wrist. So with resisted. Yeah, Wrist flexion.
P: Wrist flexion. Yeah, that hurts too.
D: Okay. And then how about if you passively extend your wrist as far down as you can go.
P: Down? Yes, that hurts too.
D: Okay. And is there any numbness or tingling anywhere?
P: No numbness or tingling.
D: Okay. Okay. So that was everything that I wanted to ask about today. Was there anything else that you wanted to mention?
P: No, that was it. What do you think? I have and how can I fix it?
D: Yeah. So certainly it sounds like with the medial aspect of your elbow having pain there over the last several months, and some of the physical exam maneuvers, such as, like passive wrist extension, resisted wrist flexion, as well as pronation and the point tenderness over the medial elbow, this could be a medial epicondylitis or a tendinopathy in that area. And so this is typically treated with activity modification. So this could be trying to avoid repetitive movements that cause pain and using medications such as Advil and Tylenol and doing strengthening and stretching exercises, which you can learn from a physiotherapist or on your own as well. And also other things at the medial side of the elbow that it could be is an ulnar ligament injury or. Yeah. Or the other thing to be considering is an ulnar ligament injury. And so if the pain isn't going away, then we might consider an ultrasound or something to look at the structures there.
P: Okay, that sounds great. Thank you.
