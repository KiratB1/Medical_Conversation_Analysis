D: I just want to start with what brings you in here today to the family clinic.
P: This morning. I. Right after I woke up, I coughed up some phlegm, and there was some blood in it, and it totally scared me.
D: Okay, and was this the first time that happened?
P: Yeah, I've never. I've never noticed blood in my sputum before.
D: Okay, but have you been coughing recently?
P: Yeah, I have had a cough recently leading up to this.
D: Okay, and how long have you had the cough for?
P: I've had it for. Yeah, about. About four weeks.
D: About four weeks. Okay. Do you know if you did anything prior to that, any new exposures or being around someone ill, like, anything like that that might have caused your cough?
P: Yeah, I was just down in. I went to Haiti on it on a trip for. For a volunteer program with my school, and I definitely noticed there was a lot of people down there coughing.
D: Okay, and did you at all live in, like, close quarters or were you crammed into, like, smaller spaces at all when you were there?

D: Okay, and did you notice at all any potential exposures to tuberculosis, anyone there that had tuberculosis or found out later?
P: Yeah, there were definitely some people around that I heard of who mentioned tuberculosis, but I don't know of anybody specifically who had it.
D: Okay, and the cough that you've been having for the last four weeks, is it like a wet cough? Are you producing any sputum or phlegm, or is it more of a dry cough?
P: I have been producing some phlegm, but it's been just kind of white yellowish.
D: Up until this morning?
P: Yeah. Or more so clear, actually, up until today where I saw some blood.
D: Okay, and how much blood was in the phlegm? Was it like a significant amount? Did it fill the whole production or just little streaks?
P: It was pretty red. It. Yeah, it was bright red, and it was covering the tissue.
D: Okay, and have you had any similar episodes before?
P: I've never brought up blood before.
D: Okay, and after this morning, was that the only time you had that, or did you. Did it recur at all?

D: Okay. Have you tried to lose weight at all or has it just been completely unintentional?

P: No, the appendix was the only thing.
D: Okay. Any family history of asthma or any. Any lung conditions, any cancers that run in the family?

D: Okay. Any heart attacks in the family or any autoimmune conditions?
P: No.
D: Okay. And currently, what is your living situation like?
P: So I live with four roommates here going to school.
D: Okay. And so do you work right now or are you just a student right now?
P: Just a student.
D: Okay. And currently, do you smoke.
P: Also? I guess, maybe. Maybe socially, so maybe a pack of cigarettes a week at the most.
D: Okay. And any recreational drug use like marijuana?
P: Yeah, I'll smoke one or two joints on the weekend with friends, socially.
D: Okay. Yeah. So, yeah. Does smoking marijuana or cigarettes make your symptoms worse at all?
P: It depends. Yeah, sometimes it can bring on some more coughing.
D: Yeah. So, yeah, we always recommend cutting down or quitting smoking whenever we see patients who are smoking, especially like, you're fairly young and you know, your grandfather had history of lung cancer with smoking throughout the year. So as early as we can quit smoking, the better for the long term health of your lungs. But whenever you're thinking of quitting or if you want any more resources about quitting, just let me know. We can set up a separate appointment for that.
P: Okay, that sounds good. Yeah, maybe. Maybe next appointment we can talk about that.
D: Okay, sounds good. Any. So no recreational. So just besides marijuana, any other recreational drugs like cocaine or crystal meth, anything of that sort?
P: No, not. Well, sometimes at parties, maybe a few times a year with friends, we'll use ecstasy or something like that, but that's only a few times a year.
D: Okay. And any alcohol?
P: Yeah, yeah, I'll have a few drinks on the weekend with friends. Usually like rum or beer.
D: Okay. Yeah. So those are all the questions I had for you today. Any questions or concerns or any ideas of what you think this might be.
P: I don't know, really concerned about the blood that I brought up. I mean, is this cancer or tuberculosis, like one of those tuberculosis infections that I heard about while I was away?
D: Yeah. So definitely cancer is pretty unlikely because you're fairly young and you've just recently started smoking. But one of the things that we're concerned about is your recent travel history being in close quarters. So definitely we need to get a chest X ray, and we can even do a sputum culture to test for tuberculosis. And then based on the results, we might have to start you on, like, a whole antibiotic regimen if it does come back as tuberculosis. Yeah, we'll get those investigations done first, and then we'll go from there.
P: Okay, thank you.
D: We'll also get some blood work done as well, so that'll be done before your next appointment. All right, that sounds good.
P: Thank you.
D: You're welcome.
