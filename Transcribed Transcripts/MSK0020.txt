D: What brings you in?
P: Just come in today because I've been having some issues with my hips as well as my knees. Just over the last. Probably a month or two, I've been just getting the stiffness and pain, especially throughout the day as the day goes along. And I also experience some stiffness when I wake up in the morning in my hips and knees. So I just wanted to come and check out what that might be.
D: Okay. And you said it started in the past month?
P: Yeah, maybe up to two months, actually. Yeah, I would say two months.
D: Okay. And is the pain and stiffness always there or does it come and go?
P: It's. It comes and goes. It's worse in the. So it's stiff. More stiff in the morning first. But like, as the day goes on, probably near the afternoon, it gets worse. So I've had to stop some of my activities like gardening and being outdoors and things like that.
D: Okay. And you said it's. It gets worse with activity. Is there anything else that makes it better or worse?
P: It probably. Yeah, if I'm just exerting myself too much in terms of better, I think I've taken some Advil. That does help with the pain.
D: Okay. Okay. And then if you were to describe the quality of this pain, would you say it's achy, throbbing, dull or sharp?
P: It's kind of like this achy pain kind of deep within the joints themselves.
D: Okay.
P: Yeah, it just gets worse as I walk more and as I do more activities.
D: Yeah. Okay. And does the pain radiate elsewhere or is it pretty localized here? Hips and knees?
P: It's mainly in those areas.
D: Okay. And severity wise, 1 to 10, 10 being the worst pain you've ever felt. How bad is this pain?
P: Probably like a 7.
D: 7. Okay. And have you ever experienced this type of pain before?
P: No, not really.
D: Okay. And do you think your pain is getting worse?

D: No. Okay, that's good. And now I'm just going to get you to do the physical exam part of this interview with me. Is that okay?
P: Yeah.
D: Okay, so we. We'll take a look at. If you can. If you have a mirror. We'll take a look at both hips first. Do you notice any redness or swelling on those hips?
P: No, not really.
D: Okay, how about any atrophy, deformities, or skin changes?
P: No.
D: No. Okay, and then how about on your knees? Do you see any redness or swelling there?
P: Not really. No.
D: No. Any atrophy, deformity, or skin changes there?
P: No.
D: No. Okay, I'm gonna get you to palpate your hip bones. Does that hurt?
P: No, not really.
D: Okay, how about when you do that to your.
P: The knee? I can feel a little bit of. I would say it's more of a discomfort than tenderness.
D: Okay, so some discomfort on the patella. Palpation. All right. And when you palpate those areas, do you feel like there's a grating sensation or does it feel warm?
P: No.
D: No. Okay. And then I'm gonna get you to. Can you flex your hips all the way? So bend. So from a sitting position, stand up first. Does it hurt when you extend your hips like that?
P: Not right now. I think I'm pretty. My hips are pretty well rested right now, but there is still a little bit of stiffness.
D: Okay. Okay, so some stiffness on hip extension. How about when you bend your hips all the way?
P: Yeah, that. I can't really go down that far, but, yeah, even bending as much as I can, there is some discomfort there.
D: Okay, so some discomfort and some pain on hip flexion, as well as limited range of motion. Okay. All right. And when you do both of those, do you hear any, like, what's called a crepitus or like a grating sensation where you feel like bone, maybe hitting bone?
P: No, not really.
D: No. Okay. All right. And I'm going to get you to extend your knee. So straighten it out. Yeah. Does that hurt?
P: Yeah, a little stiffness in my knees, and I feel like. I feel more of the grating sound in my knees.
D: Okay. Okay. And then how about when you bend your knees all the way backwards? You can do one at a time.
P: Yeah. Yeah, I definitely feel some discomfort there as well.
D: Yeah. Okay. All right. And how about when you point your toes to the ceiling?
P: No, that's fine. I can do that.
D: And then how about when you Point your toes to the ground. Yeah.
P: No issues.
D: Okay, so no pain or limited range of motion with plantar flexion or dorsiflexion. Okay, so those were all the tests that I want to do with you today. Did you have any questions or concerns?
P: No, not really.
D: No. Okay, so it sounds like what you may have is something called arthritis, which basically happens when the cushions at the ends of your bones and your joints kind of degenerate over the years. And so bone can eventually rub on bone, which causes, like, that grating sensation and causes the pain. And it happens in old age and happens with wear and tear. So to diagnose it, we. Well, yeah, we did the physical exam. We can also get an X ray of your hips and knees, which can have some findings that align with osteoarthritis. And basically, for now, we'll try to manage it conservatively. So you can take NSAIDs like ibuprofen for the pain or acetaminophen for the pain. And we'll also refer you to physiotherapy to strengthen those muscles around your joint and to increase flexibility and reduce that pain. And another thing that may be worth considering is occupational therapy, because they can help you find ways to do everyday tasks without putting too much stress on an already painful joint. And if these things don't work in the future, we can also discuss things like steroid injections or joint replacement. Does that sound like a good plan?
P: Yeah, that sounds great. Thank you so much.
D: Okay. Yeah, no worries.
