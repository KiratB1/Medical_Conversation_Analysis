P: My back just really hurts. I feel really stiff in the morning and. Yeah, it's just been going on for a few months now.
D: Okay, so for a few months, stiffness in the morning. So your back hurts. Where exactly would you say it hurts?
P: It kind of hurts all over. I can't really pinpoint any specific locations that. That hurt most. Kind of hurts, like, all down my. My back.
D: Okay. All the way up to, I guess, your neck and all the way down to your lower back.
P: I wouldn't really say the neck and I guess more of the. The lower parts. Maybe like the middle of my back and I see down and down.
D: Okay, and what kind of pain would you say it is? Is it like a dull, aching pain? Is it a sharp, stabbing pain? How would you describe it?
P: It's a dull pain.
D: Dull pain. Okay, and on a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 being the least amount of pain you felt in your life and 10 being the worst, how much would you rate it?
P: It's about a four or five. I mean, some days it can be better, but, yeah, some days it can be worse.
D: Okay, and when did this start?
P: I think this started about, like, four or five months ago. It's been going on. Yeah, for probably about half a year now.
D: Okay, and when it first started, was there anything that caused the back pain, like any kind of trauma or injury, anything that you can think of that might have led to this?
P: No, nothing that I can think of. It's sort of. It's come on so slowly. Like, when I first started noticing the back pain, it was maybe like a zero to a one. I didn't really notice it too much, but over these last five, six months, it has gotten a bit worse.
D: Okay. So it kind of came out, came on progressively. It didn't just come on suddenly at some point, right?
P: Yeah, it's been getting worse.
D: Okay, and have you ever had any previous episodes that are similar to this?

D: Okay, and have you tried anything that has helped relieve some of the pain? Any medications or anything?

D: Okay. And for your pain, are there any kind of factors that make the pain worse, like bending down or standing straight up or laying down? Anything that makes your pain worse?
P: No, nothing that I can think of that really makes it any worse.
D: Okay. And is your pain worse when you wake up in the morning or is it worse as the day progresses?
P: It's worse in the morning. It gets a bit better as the day goes on. I. About an hour into the day, I feel my best. It takes a little bit of time to move around a little bit first.
D: Okay, and approximately how much time would you say after you wake up, the stiffness and pain goes away?

P: No, I haven't noticed really. Any. Any redness or swelling.
D: Okay. And no. So are you able to bend down and stand up straight or extend backwards without pain, or are you in any pain?
P: I do get. It's a bit stiff. I. Yeah, I'm not really too sure. Like, not really. It's more. More. More stiff.
D: Okay. And yeah, other than that, do you have any questions or concerns?
P: Yeah, I was just wondering. Yeah, like what. What this could be possibly.
D: Yeah, so definitely. What. So this. This seems like it started like three months or six months ago, and it's been going on and it's happening in the morning. And how old did you say you were?
P: I'm 20. 26.
D: Okay. Yeah, so. And it seems progressive. And you're getting some pain in your other joints as well. And it's mainly from your middle to lower back. It can be multiple things that you would have to rule out. So first, you have a family history of psoriasis, so it can be psoriatic arthritis. You don't have any other skin changes or any other symptoms. It can also be, since you have had a. You were sick four months ago with what might be gastroenteritis, it can be sometimes a few months afterwards, you can get something called reactive arthritis, where you get this progressive pain in your joint and stiffness and otherwise. It can also be something called ankylosing spondylitis, which can present in men your age. And it's kind of like a progressive, dull back pain and that has some morning stiffness as well. So, yeah, there's definitely multiple things that it can be. So first we would need to do a full physical examination and book an appointment for that in person. And we will get some lab work done as well, as well as X ray of the. Of the spine and your sacroiliac joints. And we'll also get some blood work with cbc, CRP, and esr. So those are just inflammatory markers, as well as the rheumatoid factor, antinuclear antibodies. Those are just some things that will test for different kind of rheumatological issues to see if you have any arthritis. So, yeah, those are. And then we'll also get an X ray of your hands and knees since you're having pain there as well. So, yeah, those are some steps that we'll take. Do you have any questions or concerns?
P: No, that sounds great. Thank you.
D: All right. Yeah. So we'll get in touch with you shortly.
P: Sounds great.
D: Thank you. All right, take care. Bye.
