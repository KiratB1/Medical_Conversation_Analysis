D: I was wondering if you could tell me what brought you in.
P: Sure. I have been coughing a lot. I've been feeling short of breath and I just feel really wheezy so I thought I should come check it out.
D: Okay. When did the cough start?
P: I've always had a cough. Well, I guess I've had a cough for the past five years, but over the past three days it's gotten a lot worse.
D: Okay. Did anything happen three days ago that has brought the cough on?
P: No. I was. I did groceries, I came home and then I started coughing a little bit more and I haven't been able to stop since.

P: It seems to be worse in the morning.
D: Okay. And are you bringing up any sputum?

D: Okay. With your cough, prior to three days ago, were you bringing up sputum with that?
P: I guess some, but it was clear.
D: Okay. And are you bringing up more sputum now? The same or less.
P: More sputum and the sputum just looks different.
D: Okay. Have you noticed any blood?
P: No blood.
D: Okay. And you mentioned you've been. You've had a wheeze. When do you notice that?
P: I also. I guess I noticed that mostly last night. Yeah.
D: Okay. And what types of activities have you had? Shortness of breath.
P: I guess walking, doing day to day things has made me feel a little bit more short of breath than I used to feel.
D: Okay, and have you been experiencing any other symptoms besides the cough, wheeze and shortness of breath?
P: I feel a little bit more tired, but other than that?
D: No. Okay, so a bit more tired. How has your sleep been?
P: My sleep has been pretty normal. It's been. Yeah, it's been the same. I guess it's the coughing that's making me tired.
D: Okay. Have you had any ear pain or eye pain?

P: Fevers or chills? No, no, nothing like that.
D: How about night sweats?
P: No.
D: Have you had any chest pain?
P: No. Chest. Well, my chest feel. I guess sometimes it feels painful. Because I'm coughing so much, but nothing more than that.
D: Okay. Do you get chest pain when you exert yourself physically?
P: No.
D: Okay, so it's just after the coughing?
P: Yeah.
D: Okay, and how would you describe the character of the chest pain? Some people will say sharp, dull, achy.

D: Okay. In terms of your past medical history, have you been diagnosed with any conditions before?

D: Okay. Are you taking any other medications?
P: Just some calcium and vitamin D. Any.
D: Surgeries in the past?
P: Nope.
D: Any allergies to medications?
P: No.
D: Okay. And are your immunizations up to date?
P: I believe so, but I recently learned that I should get something called a pneumococcal vaccine. I haven't gotten that yet.
D: Yeah, you're right. So for in Canada, anybody. Or in Ontario at least, anybody who's older than 65, it's recommended to get this vaccine to protect against certain types of bacterial infections, a type which can cause pneumonia. So it would be good, something that you can set up with your family doctor.
P: Okay.
D: Yeah. And so are you. So do you smoke? Cigarettes?
P: I used to.
D: Okay. And how much do you smoke or how much did you used to smoke?
P: I smoked a pack a day, and I smoked for 45 years, but I stopped two years ago.
D: Okay, that's great that you were able to stop. Do you drink alcohol?
P: Occasionally. Like once every two weeks.
D: Okay. And any triggers that you can think of you were exposed to either at work or home, like chemicals or things that you were exposed to that you had to, that you breathed in?
P: No, nothing like that.
D: Okay. Have you traveled anywhere?
P: No.
D: All right. And have you been. Anybody who's been sick or has similar symptoms?
P: No.
D: All right. And anybody in the family have a heart or a lung condition?
P: No.
D: Any cancers in the family?
P: There was liver cancer.
D: Okay. And I think that. Okay. And that was all I wanted to ask. On history, was there anything else that you wanted to tell me today?
P: No. Just what do you think the problem is? I never felt this bad with my shortness of breath before.
D: Yeah, certainly. So it sounds like it could be maybe a viral infection that's brought on this cough and worsened the sputum. This could be a bacterial infection. It could be a COPD exacerbation. And also, one of the other things that we would have to consider right now is Covid as well. And so we will do a PCR nasal swab for Covid and a chest X ray and some other investigations as well, and we will try to get to the bottom of what's causing your shortness of breath.
P: Okay, that sounds good. Thank you.
