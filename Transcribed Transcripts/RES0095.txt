P: No.
D: All right. I don't think I asked. Have you had any fevers or chills? No. Okay. Or any night sweats?
P: No.
D: Okay. And I might have asked, but just to. To be complete. Did you have any nausea or vomiting?
P: No.
D: Okay. So were there any other symptoms or anything else that I may have forgot to ask about?
P: No, I don't think so. It's just the difficulties with breathing and the swelling.
D: Yeah. So the first thing, I'll speak to your daughter and we will get a look at some of the old or some of the reports from over the last several months and from the cardiologist, you see, but it's. And then also we'll get some blood work and a chest X ray, but it is sounding like this could be a heart failure exacerbation, which. So some of the shortness of breath, it could be coming from fluid that has accumulated in your lungs. And so another type of water pill now, furosemide, to try and help get rid of some of that fluid. So it will help with the breathing and in the meantime we'll wait for the investigations to come back.
P: Sure. Thank you.
