P: No, I think that was it.
D: Okay. So with the predominant symptoms of being nasal discharge and obstruction without fever and without, like, changes to smell and also without pain, it's most likely a viral rhino sinusitis. And however, this could have symptoms that overlap with COVID And so we will still end up doing a swab, even though the most likely diagnosis is going to be a viral acute rhinocytositis. Do you have any other questions?
P: No. Thank you. Thank you.
D: Thank you.
