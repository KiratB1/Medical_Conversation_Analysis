D: Hi there. I was just hoping to ask you a few questions today, but I was wondering if you could tell me what brought you in today.
P: I'm just calling about my daughter. She's been sick over the last few days. She has fever and a cough.
D: I see. Okay. When did the fever and cough start? So they started around three to four.
P: Days ago and around the same time. She was also having like a runny nose.
D: Okay, and has the fever and cough been present the whole time?
P: Yeah, I would say they started around the same time and they have been going on for the last three and a half to four days.
D: Okay, so has there been a period when she hasn't had a fever or a cough?
P: No, every time I've measured it, she has had a fever and she's been coughing for the last few days. Hasn't really changed.
D: Okay, can you think of anything leading up to these symptoms?
P: No, she was, she was fine just three to four days ago. Like before that she was playful self, no issues. But yeah, for the last couple days, just this non stop cough and the fevers is what's really worrying me.
D: Okay. Have the symptoms gotten worse or stayed the same?
P: I would say the fever has been getting a little bit worse over the last, like especially today. But the cough, coughing is about the same as what it was when it first started three days ago.
D: Okay, has she been sick like this before?
P: She's. She often gets sick. Like her brother goes to daycare and he brings a lot of bugs from there. And every time he gets sick, she also gets sick. The last time she had like a similar cough was around two months ago. But at that time I wasn't that worried because she didn't have any fevers.
D: Okay, have you, has there been anything that you've tried to help with the cough or fever?
P: Tylenol. I gave her Tylenol. It did help her a little bit, but then the fever came right back. I'd say like a few hours later.
D: Okay, and anything you noticed that's made the cough or fever worse over the last three or four days?
P: Not anything that I know of. Her fever's been getting worse, but I don't really know why that is.
D: Okay, has she been having any other symptoms.
P: Other than like, yeah, she had the runny nose when it first started and then she's also been having some diarrhea.
D: Okay, and when did the diarrhea start?
P: I think I would say it started around two days ago. She's like, every time I change her diaper she would have like four to five different diaper changes throughout the day and they seem pretty liquid. So I think yeah, she's been having diarrhea for the last two days.
D: Okay, you mentioned liquid appearing stool. What would you say? So I guess, could you comment on that consistency and color?
P: Consistency? I would say it's pretty watery, like diarrhea and color. I didn't really think there's any changes in the color.
D: Okay, so you didn't think there was any blood in the stool?
P: No, no, no, I didn't see any blood.
D: Okay, as for the fever, what was the maximum temperature that you noted and how did you check it?
P: So I used. We have a just a regular non digital thermometer in her ear and her temperature today was around 103 degrees Fahrenheit.
D: Okay. Did you notice any tugging or pulling at her ear?
P: No, no, she didn't seem to have any irritation there.
D: Okay, how about any vomiting or regurgitation?
P: No, she's been keeping food down. No issues there.
D: Okay. And notice any discharge from either eye?
P: Nope.
D: How about any discharge from ears?
P: Not that I've noticed. Nope.
D: Notice any rashes?
P: Nope. I didn't not known like new rashes? No.
D: Okay. And how has she been in terms of mood or behavior?
P: She's been pretty, like she's not herself. Over the last few days she's been crying a lot more, just very irritable.
D: Okay. Would you say inconsolable at times?
P: Sometimes like yesterday like she. I couldn't get her to stop crying.
D: Okay. And I know you said no vomiting, but has she been coughing up any sputum?
P: Yeah, I would say this green, slimy content. Yeah, it's like green and slimy.
D: Okay, how much would you say, like a cup or more?
P: I would say probably like at least, at least a couple spoonfuls at a time. She would cough up.
D: Okay. And did you notice any blood in it?
P: No, I didn't notice any blood at all.
D: Okay. And with the cough, have you noticed any difficulties breathing?
P: I don't know if it's difficulty breathing, but I have noticed sometimes she's like breathing faster than normal, like taking a lot more breaths.
D: I see. Okay. Is she having troubles with drooling or trouble speaking?
P: No, I haven't noticed that.
D: Okay. And does her voice sound normal to you?
P: Yeah, I think her voice hasn't really changed that much.
D: Okay, with the noticing the faster rate of breathing. Is the breathing noisy at all?
P: No, like she's not wheezing or anything.
D: Okay. And do you notice any like retraction of the Skin between her ribs when breathing.
P: So, like. Like, what do you mean by that?
D: Like, just so when she's breathing in and out. Yeah, she's generating a lot of force and effort to really kind of suck in and blow out. So you can kind of see maybe impressions over the ribs?
P: Oh, no, I don't think I've noticed that. No.
D: Okay, and have you noticed any bluish discoloration around her lips or mouth?
P: Nope.
D: Okay. And any urinary problems?
P: No, she's peeing fine.
D: Okay. And how has she been sleeping the last few days?
P: She hasn't really been sleeping. In between the crying and, like, just being so irritable, I think she's just very uncomfortable when she's trying to get to sleep. So I would say not like maybe a couple hours for the last few nights.
D: Okay. Any evidence of seizure or limb jerking?
P: No, not that I noticed. Nope.
D: Okay, and have you noticed her being, like, really lethargic at all?
P: She's not her stubborn. She's still, like, pretty active. Like, she's. She just seems really unhappy and irritated. But no, she still has energy.
D: Okay, and is she drinking? Yeah, a lot more fluids or. Or a lot less. How is she tolerating oral intake?
P: I would say I think she's more on the drier side. Like, she. Her mouth is very dry, her lips are, like, all cracked, and she. It seems that she's drinking less water.
D: I see. Okay, and how many wet diapers would you say in the last 24 hours?
P: Yeah, it's difficult to say. I think, like, yesterday changed four to five times. They were all diarrhea, so not really sure, but maybe around five.
D: Okay, and have you guys traveled anywhere recently?
P: No. No. Rupin here.
D: Okay, so next, just some questions about past medical history. Has she had any medical problems in the past?
P: The only thing I could think of was after she was born, she had to be given the light treatment for jaundice, but after that, no other problems.
D: Okay. Any prior surgeries? No. Any previous hospitalizations?
P: Nope, just a light treatment, but other than that, nothing.

D: Okay, and has she been around anybody sick recently?
P: Just her big brother who goes to daycare was also like a bit sick with a cough and some runny nose for the last four days. But he didn't have a fever and he seemed to recover pretty fast, but seems she may have caught it from him.
