D: Okay. Okay. So those are all the questions I have for you today. Any questions for me?
P: No.
D: Okay. So, yeah, there's definitely, like, the coughing and the shortness of breath are definitely concerning, and they've been going on for a pretty long time. Do you have any night sweats or anything like that?
P: No.
D: So there's a few things that we think about with the chronic shortness of spread and a cough one could be just a COPD diagnosis. With your long history of this function test, get an X ray, chest X ray as well. The other thing that we need to look out for is lung cancer. And since you have been smoking for a pretty long time, even though you may have quit, which is really great, but that long history of smoking, especially also with you working in a mine, those are some things that need to think of as well. And so we may require like a chest X ray and even CT scan of your lungs as well. Yeah. First we'll just do a couple of tests, do a physical examination, get your vitals, do some blood work and do some of those tests. And then we'll also get a Covid swab test done for you as well just in case. Does that sound good?
P: Yeah.
D: Great. So we'll be with you shortly.
