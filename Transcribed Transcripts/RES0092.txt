You had a cold last week and you just have this residual cough that's still there and it's been two weeks and you're just worried about it, but otherwise we're feeling well. You don't have any other symptoms? Oftentimes when we get sick or we have an infection or inflammation of the. Of the airway, we can get a cough that lasts a long time and it might just take you a couple more weeks for the cough to go away. But if you feel that it's getting any worse or you have those symptoms come back again or you develop a fever, we can do something more about that. I'll also do a physical exam and see how you're doing and then we can go from there.
P: Okay, great. Thank you.
