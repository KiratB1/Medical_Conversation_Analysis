P: No.
D: Okay. And are you currently working?
P: Yeah, so I'm working in construction. I used to work in shipyards before, but recently I've been doing some construction. Nothing heavy, just working on some old buildings. I'll just take the odd job or something. Something that comes up. It's not full time.
D: Okay. And any concerns for, like, exposures while you're at work in terms of, like, breathing in any dusts or any fumes?
P: We're given personal protective equipment for those concerns. But when I was younger, I used to work in shipyards and constructions and, like, old buildings and stuff. And I know there was some concern for not being properly equipped with the right equipment for protection and safety at that point. So, yeah, it's possible I've been exposed to some things.
D: I see. Is there a chance that there could have been asbestos at any of those places that you worked?
P: Yeah, asbestos, mold? Yeah. You name it. Probably everything.
D: I see this was like 10 years ago, 20 years ago or longer?
P: Yeah, so it would have been. Yeah, about like 30 years ago or. Yeah, 30, 40 years ago. And I worked in those places for 30 to 40 years, so around that time.
D: Okay. And do you smoke cigarettes?
P: I quit recently since I found out that I might have copd.

D: Okay. And any concern for a sexually transmitted infection?
P: No.
D: Okay. And I think that was everything that I wanted to ask on history today. Was there anything else that. That you wanted to add that I maybe forgot about?
P: No, that was it. But how? Like, what can I take to make these symptoms go away?
D: Well, yeah, so at this time, it will be important to get some lung imaging and possibly some other investigations as well. Because of your exposure to inhalants and fumes and possibly asbestos. I'm concerned there could be possibly an asbestos related lung illness that you have, and so it'll be important to investigate for Adam, possibly a asbestos related lung cancer. Okay. Yeah.
P: Okay. Thank you.
