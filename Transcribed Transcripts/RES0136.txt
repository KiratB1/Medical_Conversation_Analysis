P: No.
D: So, yeah, definitely with the coughing and shortness of breath, we will definitely get a Covid swab test done. I should come back in the next 24 to 48 hours, and then public health will contact you. Yeah. Based on what you're telling me so far, we'll definitely do a physical examination, get your vitals and get your oxygenation and everything done. But I also think since you were very drowsy and had fallen asleep and were difficult to wake up, sometimes you can get what's called aspiration pneumonia, and that can also be a possibility. And what we will do is get a chest X ray, get some blood work done as well today. You may require antibiotics, and if your vitals are unstable, we might have to admit you as well. Does that sound good?
P: Yeah.
D: All right. So, yeah, we'll get those tests done, and we'll be there with you shortly. We'll also get, like, an EKG done as well.
P: Sure.
D: Right. Okay.
