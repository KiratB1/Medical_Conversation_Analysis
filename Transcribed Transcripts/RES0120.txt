P: Yeah, like, what do you think? I have Covid.
D: Yeah. So right now, it's definitely something that's on everyone's mind. Some of these symptoms, the shortness of breath and fever, definitely can be Covid. And that's something that we are going to test you with, and that's something we test everyone with. But because you're having shortness of breath, we do need to make sure nothing else is going on as well. You can potentially have pneumonia. That's not Covid. It can be any other virus or bacteria. So we will get some blood work done. We'll get your temperature and all your vitals taken as well, and then get a chest X ray as well. And if it turns out at all that you have pneumonia, we'll just reassess and see if you need to stay in the hospital for longer. If you need any antibiotics within the hospital or you can take them at home. So, yeah, we'll do a full physical examination and do all those tests and then go from there.
P: Okay, that sounds great. Thank you.
D: You're welcome. Yeah, we'll be there with you shortly.
P: Okay, great.
