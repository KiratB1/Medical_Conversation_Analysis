D: How are you doing today?
P: I'm doing okay. I just had this cough that's really started to bug me.
D: Okay. We're coming into the emergency department today. We'll really try to get this sorted out for you. How long has this cough been going on?
P: For about five days.
D: Okay, five days. And has anything else come on during that time? Are you having any other symptoms?
P: Yeah, I've been feeling pretty. Pretty hot and just haven't been really feeling very good overall. I've been just exhausted.
D: I'm sad to hear that. Have you ever had anything like this before?
P: Maybe when I was younger. I don't know when I had the flu or something like that.
D: Okay. Okay. So I'll ask you a few more questions about your cough. So it started five days ago. Has it gotten any worse or better since then?
P: It's been getting worse for sure. It's like going all throughout the day, and it's been even interrupting sleep.
D: Oh, geez, that's too bad. Do you find that it. Does it feel really dry or are you bringing up, like, gunky stuff?
P: It's really dry.
D: Okay. Is there anything that seems to make it worse or better?
P: Not really. It's pretty consistent throughout the day.
D: Okay. Okay. Have you had any chest pain?
P: Yeah, after coughing, it's starting to hurt. It didn't that first, but now that I've. I think I've coughed so much, I'm starting to feel pain there.
D: Okay. What. What part specifically in your chest are you feeling pain in?
P: Actually, now that I think of it, it's more. More to my throat, actually. I would say with the cough. Yeah, yeah, more of the throat.
D: So you'd say you have. You've had a sore throat?
P: Yeah, I guess so. Yeah. With the. Now with the cough. That's really kind of what I mean by what has been bugging me.
D: Okay. Okay. Thanks for sharing that with me. And along with this, have you noticed any change in your sense of smell or taste?
P: Yeah, my smell has definitely been off, which is kind of weird. My taste has been fine, though.
D: Okay. Okay. And when did that start?
P: Yeah, now that you say it, I mean. Well, I guess this morning.
D: Okay. Have you had any nausea or vomiting?
P: No, nothing like that.
D: Okay. And you said you felt really hot. Have you taken your temperature at all?
P: No, I haven't. That's. But I've been feeling pretty sweaty, so that's where I. I feel like I have a fever, so I wanted to come in.
D: Okay. Okay. Have you lost any weight recently? Like, unintentionally?
P: No. I've actually put on probably five or ten pounds.
D: Okay. Okay. Have you had. Felt any. Any chills or shakes?
P: Nothing like that.
D: Have you had any night sweats?
P: Yeah, actually, last night my shirt was soaked right through when I got up.
D: Oh, no. Okay. And was that just last night?
P: Yeah. Yeah, that was just last night.
D: Okay. Okay. So I'm just gonna ask you some questions. Oh, sorry. A few more questions on this and then we'll move on to just your health in general. Have you traveled anywhere recently?
P: No, I've been. Been. Well, just going to work and at home.
D: Okay. Have you been in contact with anyone that might be sick?
P: It's. Well, it's hard to say. At the grocery store, I guess. I see a lot of customers that come through, but generally things are wiped down pretty frequently.
D: You work at the grocery store?
P: Yeah.
D: Okay. And do you live alone or with family?
P: Yeah, I live with family. I live with my wife and two children.
D: Oh, nice. And do they work out of the home? Have they been in contact with anyone that's been sick?
P: Well, they're in high school and they've actually been doing a lot of their coursework online, so, yeah, I haven't really been around too many other people.
D: And your wife?
P: Yeah, she's been home as well.
D: Okay. Okay. So in terms of your overall health, are there any conditions that you see your family doctor for regularly?
P: Yeah, so I have high blood pressure and type 2 diabetes, and so I take Ramapril and Metformin.
D: Okay. Ramipril, Metformin. Any other medications?
P: Vitamin D. Okay.
D: And have you ever had any surgeries?
P: Yeah, I had my gallbladder taken out, but 10 years ago or so.
D: Okay. Okay. So do you have any allergies.
P: Just to, like, environmental stuff like pollen, I think.
D: Okay. Okay. So not any allergies to any medications?
P: No.
D: Okay. Okay. Do you have any family history of respiratory problems?
P: I think my brother has asthma. I think my mom has asthma, too.
D: Okay. Okay. And in terms of your lifestyle, so it sounds like you live with your wife and kids, you work at a grocery store on a weekly basis. Do you drink alcohol?
P: Maybe I'll have, like three or four beers on the weekend.
D: Okay, so three to four drinks per week?
P: Yeah, about that.
D: Do you smoke?
P: No, I do not.
D: Okay. Do you use cannabis or any other substances?
P: No, I don't use anything like that.
D: Okay. Okay. Well, I think that just about covers the things that I wanted to ask you today. So based on the symptoms you're experiencing, it sounds like it'd be some kind of infective process, like maybe some kind of viral infection. Because COVID 19 is something that we're concerned about, particularly this year. I'd really like to get a swab done on you. It's not necessarily Covid, but it potentially could be. So what we're going to have to ask you to do is to self isolate you and your family for 14 days. And hopefully we'll get the results back shortly and you'll know whether your COVID test is positive or not.
P: Okay? Yeah, that sounds good.
D: Okay, well, thanks for chatting with me. We'll get that.
P: Thank you.
