D: Okay, so next, I just wanted to move on to the physical exam piece of the appointment today. So just looking at your. At your feet and the joints of the ankle and toes, are you seeing any swelling, redness or. Any swelling or redness?
P: No, no swelling or redness.
D: Is there a temperature change to your feet or any of the joints? Are they feeling hot or cold?

D: Okay, and then how about over any of the joints of your toes?
P: No, not. Nothing like that. No pain. Just. I can't feel it.
D: Okay. And how is the range of motion of your feet and toes?
P: Pretty good. I can move them all.
D: Okay, and then how about your knees?
P: My knees are also the same.
D: Okay. And any ankle, like, instability with any special tests?
P: No.
D: Okay. And on walking, is there any limp or does it appear. How does the walk appear?
P: Pretty normal. I'm not limping.
D: Okay. And. Okay. So that was everything that I wanted to ask and check today. Did you have any questions?
P: Just what do you think is going on with my feet and how do I get some sensation back?
D: So it does sound like it could be related to diabetes, where what happens is you get like a peripheral neuropathy over time and you can lose sensation to your feet and a glove and stocking distribution, which sounds like the history. History you're saying today with having sensation reduced on your feet and also your fingertips as well, where you'll lose sensation and you can't feel pain and so but other things to consider could be possibly like vitamin deficiencies or things like that but that would be much much lower down on the differential. And so to regain sensation I think really the only thing that can be done now is to help prevent further damage to the nerves and that would be to make sure that the diabetes is under good control and trying to monitor your feet as regularly as you can making sure that there aren't any kind of open wounds or sores that are not healing. If things are not healing it'll be important to check to see if there is an underlying infection such as osteomyelitis which will prevent wound healing and so if there are any is anything like that it would be important to have that checked out. So feet hygiene is extremely important as we're working on improving that diabetes control as well as things like cutting down alcohol could could also help as well.
P: Okay. Okay thank you.
