D: What brings you in?
P: Hi. I've just been a little bit worried that for the last couple of months, I noticed I'm getting more and more out of breath when I've been doing exercise. And I know I got a brother who had a heart issue, and I'm just really concerned that I might have something wrong with my ticker. Just want to get it checked out, you know?
D: Yeah, for sure. When did the shortness of breath start?
P: So this winter, specifically, like, we haven't been too active because of COVID this year. We've just been staying in the house all last year, but with the snow, like, I'd be shoveling snow whenever it fell, and before I could be able. Like, two years ago, I'd be able to clear the driveway, no problem. But now, even after half the driveway, I've noticed I'm getting consistently out of breath. I've got this nasty cough, and it's prompted my wife to kind of get me to come in. She's a little bit worried.
D: Yeah. So it's mostly on exertion. It doesn't happen at rest.
P: Is that correct, Being out of breath?
D: Yeah.
P: No.
D: Okay. Okay. And has this ever happened to you before?
P: Yeah, about a year and a half ago, we went down to Toronto in order to see the CN Tower and just, you know, do tourist stuff. And I tried. We tried climbing a couple of flights of stairs, you know, just to do a little bit, and I could not. I always thought myself pretty healthy, pretty active, but it really took the wind out of my sail, so I had to stop, stooped over, just couldn't do it.
D: And how did you manage? Like, how was that treated at that time? How did you get better?
P: Oh, I didn't do anything. I just attributed to being, I don't know, out of shape a little bit. I worked as a mechanic when I was younger. I was pretty active, but ever since retiring, I thought I'd keep up. At least my stamina. Wouldn't go away that quickly, but chalked it up to being out of shape and went home.
D: Okay, so your symptom, your shortness of breath seems to be getting worse.
P: Yeah.
D: Right. Okay. Any coughing with that?
P: Yeah. Yeah. Not necessarily when I noticed it when I was shoveling the driveway, but I've had a cough for the last couple of years. Usually in the morning, I just bring up a little bit of gunk, but most of my buddies have that. Just like a morning cough, you know?
D: Yeah. And the gunk that you bring up, what color is it?
P: Yellow, Sometimes a little brown.
D: Okay. And when did that start?
P: Oh, what's been going on last 10 years? Well, to be honest, since I've been, like, 30, but it's been fairly consistent. Last 10 years, I'd say.
D: Okay. Any blood that you bring up?
P: Not that I've noticed. Like bright red? No, nothing like that.
D: Okay. Any wheeziness?
P: Yeah, yeah, I noticed that when I was shoveling. Yeah. When I was out of breath, it sound. Sound different. Sound different than being usually out of breath? It sounded wheezy.
D: Okay. Any chest pain?
P: Yeah, a little bit, actually.
D: At rest or.
P: Nothing like that? Nothing, Nothing when I'm not moving.
D: Okay, so the chest pain, when did that start?
P: First noticed it this winter on the driveway. But it wasn't like. I know what they say about a heart. As opposed to, like, the crushing pain in your chest that moves up your neck? Nothing like that. Like my lungs, my throat. Like you're really, really out of breath, you know?
D: Okay, so you're attributing it mostly to your shortness of breath then?
P: I think so. I really hope this isn't my heart. I've never had a heart attack.
D: Yeah. Where in your chest? Is this chest pain happening? Like, is it central? Is it more towards the left, towards the right?
P: It was kind of both sides.
D: Okay.
P: It was. Yeah. All across my chest. To be honest. It was only the one time I was really struggling and I coughed up a bit. Yeah.
D: Okay. Any pain in your calves or legs after you walk a certain distance?
P: No, no, no.
D: Do you ever feel like your heart's racing?
P: Felt like my heart was racing after that much activity, but no, not usually.
D: Okay. How about swelling in your limbs?
P: No, nothing like that.
D: Okay. Any fainting spells or dizziness?
P: No, never fainted in my life.
D: Okay. Any confusion, memory loss?
P: No, nothing like that.
D: Headaches?
P: Headaches. You know, I do get headaches from time to time. I always associate them with stress, but I haven't been too stressed out recently, so nothing in the last couple years.
D: Okay. Any neck stiffness?
P: Nope.
D: No. Okay. Any sensitivity to light or loud sounds associated with that headache?
P: No, nothing like that.
D: Okay. Any weight loss?
P: No, I wish.
D: Okay. Fevers?
P: No.
D: Rashes?
P: You know, I got these weird things on my head, I think mainly because of the sun, like these brown patches. But that wouldn't be a rash, would it?
D: I have to examine that closer. If you think it's associated with the sun, it could be something like seborrhoic keratosis. But I'd have to see what they look like so we can take a look at that later. That's okay. So any changes in your vision or hearing?
P: Nope.
D: No. Stuffy nose, Runny nose?
P: I had a bit of a cold a couple months ago, but no, nothing recent.
D: Okay. Sore throat?
P: Yeah, a little bit after the cough. I had a little bit of a sore throat, but went away pretty quickly.
D: Okay. Change in smell or taste?
P: Have been able to smell or taste too well for a while.
D: What's a while?
P: 10 years? 7 years. It's been more salt, more spices on my food, you know?
D: Okay. Okay. Any changes to your bowel habits?
P: Nope. Been regular all my life.
D: Nausea, vomiting? Nope. Okay. Joint pain, muscle aches, you know, my.
P: Knees have been giving me trouble for a while, but nothing recent. No.
D: Okay. And are you otherwise healthy?
P: Nope. Got high blood pressure. See the doc about that. High cholesterol? See the doc about that. And. Yeah, I don't know. Got into a car crash in my 40s. Broke my arm one time. Nothing else really.
D: Okay. Any surgeries?
P: I think I had my appendix out when I was. Yeah, I had my appendix out when I was, like, 12.
D: Okay.
P: No, never been under the knife since then.
D: Okay, good. Have you been taking any medications for that high blood pressure?
P: Yeah, docs got me on two blood pressure medications and one cholesterol medication.
D: Okay. And do you take those frequently?
P: Yeah, every day.
D: Okay, good. Any other medications?
P: Nope.
D: Are you up to date with all your immunizations?
P: Geez, it's been a while since I got an immunization. Think? Yeah, I think so.
D: Okay. Once you turn 65, they usually give you Shingrex for to prevent shingles and a Pneumovax vaccine to prevent pneumococcal infections. Have you had those ones?
P: Nope.
D: No. Okay, so if you're interested in getting those, we can discuss that at some point today as well.
P: Okay.
D: Do you have any allergies?
P: No.
D: No. Okay, so you mentioned a family history of your brother having congenital heart disease. Any other heart diseases that run in the family?
P: Congenital? What's that mean?
D: Like something that you're born with?
P: No, I don't think he's ever born a thing. He had a couple heart attacks.
D: Oh, heart attacks. Okay. Sorry, I must have misinterpreted that. How old was he when he had his first heart attack?
P: He's older than me by five years, but he had the first one when I was younger than I am now. Like, 62 was the first one. Another one at 65.
D: Okay, is he. Did they ever find a cause for his heart attack? Is he a healthy person?
P: Healthy? He's Healthy. You know, I wouldn't call him too healthy of a guy. He's a. He's a hard liver. Let's call him that. Why it happened, I think, honestly, it's his diet. Man eats like a hog. Steaks, butter, bacon. I'm assuming that's what did him in.
D: Oh, yikes. Okay. Okay. Any other heart conditions that run in the family or other members of the family experiencing heart attacks?
P: Yep. Dad died young from a heart attack. He was. He died younger than I am now. He passed away at 66.
D: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
P: Oh, it's been years now.
D: Yeah.
P: What it is. His grandmother had a stroke. High blood pressure on my mom's side. High cholesterol on my mom's side too, but, yeah, an awful lot of heart attacks on my father's side of the family.
D: Okay. Any other lung. Any lung conditions that run in the family?
P: None that come to mind.
D: Okay. And do you smoke?
P: Yeah. Yeah, I smoke.
D: Okay. How much do you smoke?
P: I cut it back about half a pack a day the last two years now.
D: Okay. And before that?
P: That was pretty much a pack a day. Maybe when I was bad. Two packs a day. But I've been smoking. Yeah. Since about when did I start working at the shop? 17. Everyone there smoked, so.
D: Okay. Wow. Yeah. It's been a while then. But it's good that you cut down. That's good. Do you do any other recreational drugs like marijuana, cocaine, heroin, anything?
P: I'll smoke weed at the shop every Friday, but I'm not a huge fan of it, to be honest.
D: Okay. And how much do you smoke every Friday?
P: Go through about four joints, seven people. Seven. I don't know what that is. Half a gram?
D: Half a joint. Half. Okay. Yeah. Okay. And do you drink?
P: Oh, yeah.
D: How much do you drink?
P: Let's see. Christmas was about the last time I went heavy. I'll have like a beer or two weekends, but when family's in town, we'll. We'll go whole hog. I'll drink maybe 20 beer.
D: Oh, okay. Okay. Yeah, you should. Have you thought about cutting that down?
P: You gotta keep up with the family, you know? You can't let them embarrass you like that.
D: That's. I understand that. But also, you know, it's important to take care of your health. And slow and steady wins the race. Right.
P: I'll keep that in mind, doctor.
D: Yeah. And how's your diet been?
P: Pretty good. The wife's been on a health food craze last five years. Vegetables? I don't know I eat whatever she cooks, basically.
D: Okay, that's good. And in terms of exercise, do you get to move around?
P: I used to be pretty active. I used to bike around, but because of COVID I've just been indoors all this time, so. No, not much.
D: Okay. Okay. Well, it's good to go out for a walk once in a while. I think that's allowed during COVID As long as you're being safe. And who do you live with at home?
P: I live with my wife.
D: Okay. Any children?
P: Yeah, I got three kids. One for my first marriage, two with the Mrs. Right now.
D: Okay. Do you get to see them often?
P: Yeah. Daughter lives in town. I'm gonna see her in the grandkid a bit. Other boy works at Fort Mac. And my oldest son, he's out east.
D: Okay.
P: Don't get us going too much.
D: Okay. And have you had any contacts with people who've been sick recently?
P: No, we've been keeping entirely to ourselves. You can get our groceries ordered to the house.
D: Okay. And how about travel? Any recent travel?
P: No.
D: No. Okay. And then lastly, I just wanted to ask you, because you have been smoking for a long time, have you ever been diagnosed with something called copd?
P: Hmm, doesn't ring a bell.
D: No. Okay. Have you ever had any pulmonary function tests or chest X rays done in the past?
P: Chest X ray? I think they did a chest X ray after the car crash, but I can't think of getting one recently. No.
D: Okay. All right, well, those are all the questions that I had for you. Did you have any questions for me?
P: So this is a heart. Like, should I be worried?
D: Yeah. You know what? It sounds, from what you're telling me? It sounds like you have shortness of breath on exertion. It sounds like you have a cough producing, some phlegmic. It doesn't seem like you have any systemic symptoms of infection, so I'm not too worried about that. And then in terms of your heart, you mentioned you had that chest pain once, but it really does sound more like a lung problem to me than a heart problem to me right now. But of course, we'll do all the necessary investigations to rule out any heart stuff, but right now I'm thinking it could be something called copd, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disorder, because of your smoking history. So we'll start with doing a pulmonary function test and chest X ray, and I will try to go from there. If it is copd, we'll likely put you on, like, puffer for that. Like, a lot. A short or long acting beta agonist that's what it's called. So if your symptoms don't get better with that, we'll do other investigations to try to figure out what this is. How does that sound?
P: Sounds great, Doc. Thanks a million.
D: All right, great. Thank you.
