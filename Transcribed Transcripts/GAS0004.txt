D: I understand that you've been having some diarrhea. Can you tell me a little bit about that?
P: Yeah, sure. I had. I've been having diarrhea for the past three to four days, and it's been pretty bad. I couldn't go. I couldn't go to my classes. Had to skip because I was just. It was just embarrassing.
D: Okay, I'm starting to hear that. Have you ever experienced anything like this before?
P: Have I ever experienced something like this before? I don't think so.
D: Okay. And over the three or four days, have your stools all been loose or have you had some solid ones in between?
P: I think they've mostly been loose. I think they've all been loose, actually, if I think about it.
D: Okay. And how many times a day have you been having episodes of diarrhea?
P: Oh, my God. I have. I've lost count. I'm going every. Every hour, maybe.
D: Okay. Okay. And have you noticed any changes in the color of your stool?
P: No, it's brown.
D: Okay. Any blood in your stool that you've noticed?
P: Not really. I don't think so. I don't look that much, to be honest.
D: Okay. Have you noticed any pain associated with it?
P: Well, I didn't start off with pain, but I do have a bit of a cramp now since yesterday. It's just. It hurts? Yeah, it hurts. Sometimes it comes and goes.
D: Okay. And do you feel that when it. Do you feel that you still have control over releasing it? Does it come on and you don't even notice that it has happened or you still are able to kind of have a warning before you get to the toilet?
P: No, I do get a warning, but it's just. I do need to get to the toilet really fast.
D: Okay. And before this happened, have you noticed. Have you. Is there anything that you've done differently, that you've been eating differently or any other changes that have happened in your life recently?
P: I. I did go to. I did go to a new restaurant five days ago.
D: Okay. What did you have there?
P: I just got some rice with chicken Manchurian. It was a nice little Chinese restaurant. And. Yeah.
D: Did anyone else have the same thing that you did that you were with?
P: I. No, not really. I went with my friend, and I haven't really. I haven't talked to her about this. I never really thought that these were related, that this was related to that.
D: And it's, you know, absolutely. Potentially not. Like, it's. Maybe not it could possibly be. So not to worry you about that. We just like to get an idea of kind of the whole picture of what you're coming in with. So in terms of the last three to four days, have you experienced any nausea or vomiting?
P: Yeah, yeah, I have actually, but it's not been as bad as the diarrhea. I didn't even. Yeah, I didn't. I wasn't even thinking about that. Yeah, I. I did vomit, I think twice yesterday.
D: Okay. Have you noticed any blood in the vomit?
P: No, it's just watery.
D: Okay. And are you nauseated all the time or is it kind of on and off?
P: It's on and off.
D: Okay. Have you taken any, any over the counter medicine or anything to help?
P: Not really. I was, I was just trying to drink a lot of water because I. I know that I. I can get dehydrated, so just drinking lots of water.
D: Okay, well, that's good to hear. Have you been eating normally or have you not been eating as much as you regularly do?
P: I have been eating less, especially since yesterday when I had these abdominal cramps started. I just don't feel like eating.
D: Okay. Is there anything that has been making it worse?
P: Making what worse?
D: Just in general. Like, is there anything that you're finding makes your nausea or your diarrhea come on?
P: Not really. I don't think so.
D: Do you notice any changes to your urine or any discomfort when going to the bathroom?
P: No.
