D: Okay. Okay. Well, those are all the questions that I had. Did you have anything that you wanted to add that I maybe missed?
P: No, I just. It's been going on for two years, and I feel like it's getting worse and worse. Yeah, I'm just scared of having to, you know, go on oxygen or, like, just not being able to breathe at one point.
D: Yeah, for sure. So we'll try to do a good job working you up for everything that we think it may be. And right now it sounds like it could be pulmonary fibrosis, either, like, you know, an autoimmune process or triggered after, like, an infection that you may have had in the past. We will definitely also look in to see if it's perhaps a lung cancer, asthma. And you mentioned you don't smoke, so we don't think it could be copd. But we'll also test for that in case everything else comes back negative.
P: Okay, sounds good. Thank you so much.
D: Thank you. Take care.
P: You too.
