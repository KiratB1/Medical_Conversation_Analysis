P: Yeah, right now it's online school right now due to the pandemic.
D: Okay, and has anybody at home been sick or have you been around? Anybody who's been sick?
P: My brother did have, like, similar sore throat symptoms, I think maybe two weeks ago, and he did get some medications from the doctor.

P: I think so. I think he got some antibiotics.
D: Okay, and have you traveled anywhere recently?

D: Okay. And how's school going?
P: School's going pretty well. No real issues. It took some time in adjusting to the new online curriculum, but it's going pretty well now.
D: Okay, that's good. I'm glad that you've been able to adjust. So I think that was everything I wanted to ask about on history today. Did you have anything else that you maybe wanted to add or that I maybe forgot to ask about?
P: No, I think that those were all the questions I had.
D: Okay. So with your current symptoms right now with no cough, tonsillar exudate, a fever, also your age, and the swelling and redness that you notice in the back of your throat, it's likely a group A strep pharyngitis that's causing this. And with your exposure to your brother, who also received antibiotics, could be potentially be a sick contact for you that you're around. So this would require antibiotics as well for yourself. And we'll do a rapid strep antigen test to check for this and wait on the result for that, because it still could possibly be a viral illness. And so if that test is negative and we're thinking it's a viral illness, then we might hold off on the antibiotics for now and monitor symptoms. And if at any point things get worse, like you start to get shortness of breath, or your fever's getting worse and it's not being controlled, then we'll reassess the situation.
P: Okay, sounds good. Thank you so much.
D: Thank you.
