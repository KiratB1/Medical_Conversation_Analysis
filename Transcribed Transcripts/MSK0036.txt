D: How may I help you?
P: I've just been experiencing some pain and numbness and tingling in just my wrist area and thumb, middle finger and index finger.
D: Okay, and when did this pain start? And is it the right hand or left hand?
P: It's the right, it's the right hand, but I also find it's starting to happen in the left hand as well, but more so on the right hand. I feel this kind of sensation over my palms and fingers. It started, I would say, probably two weeks ago and it's been. I think it's gradually been getting worse. I'm having more difficulty at nighttime especially. It's also waking me up from sleep and it's. Yeah, just affecting my daily routine, my work. So, yeah, I just wanted to understand what was going on.
D: Okay, I see. And did you have any trauma to the wrist or any injury or have you had an injury in the past?
P: No, I haven't had any falls, no accidents, nothing like that.
D: Okay, and are you right or left handed?
P: I'm right handed.
D: Okay. And you mentioned it was the right hand that started to hurt first and then the left one has started since then. Yeah, yeah.
P: And I don't know if it's just because I use my right hand more that I feel more pain and the symptoms, but yeah, I definitely would say it's worse.
D: Okay, and where are you finding that the pain is specifically located?
P: So the pain, I feel like it's more of like a discomfort just over the palm, like near the wrist. And the lower palm area is where the discomfort is. And then the numbness and tingling is just like in my thumb in the first two digits.
D: Okay, and how would you describe the character of this sensation? Is it burning? Is it sharp, achy, or stabby?
P: I would say it's more of kind of like an aching, aching pain. It does sometimes turn into kind of like a burning sensation with the tingling, but yeah, more so on the palmer, like on the palm side of things, it's more of like an aching pain.
D: Okay, and you have some burning as well?
P: Yeah.
D: Okay. And does the, does it radiate anywhere? Are you feeling this in your neck, shoulder, or down your arm at all?
P: It kind of goes from the palm along. So it goes from the palm, it goes upwards, like to my fingers, but also backwards, like into my lower arm as well, like my forearm.
D: Okay. And do you have any pain in the neck?
P: In my neck, yeah. No.
D: Okay. And anything that you've done that makes the pain worse?
P: I just have to, like, I work as an accountant. There's A lot of work I do on the computer with the keyboard mouse, so I feel like it's hard to really do that all day right now. So I think if I do that.
D: I'll make it worse.
P: But if I take a rest and kind of just shake my hands a little bit, then it gets better.
D: Okay, so kind of like flicking your, like, wrist sort of thing to kind of shake out the okay. And anything that you do that that makes it but better. Besides those moves, like, have you taken any medications or tried any, like, wrist splints or anything like that?
P: No, I haven't tried any medications or splints.
D: Okay, and what is the severity of the pain on a scale of 1 to 10, 10 being the worst you've ever felt? And do you feel this pain at any particular time of day more than others?

P: I'm living with my husband and two kids in a small townhouse.
D: I see. And you mentioned you're an accountant. Are you working right now?
P: Yeah, I'm an accountant, but I'm self employed, so I've taken some time off and just taking a little bit easy before I find out like, what this is and how this will really impact my work.
D: I see. Okay. And have you been around anybody who's been sick recently?
P: No.
D: Have you traveled anywhere?
P: No.

P: No.
D: Okay. And do you drink alcohol?
P: Just maybe some wine Every other day.
D: Okay. And in the family, are there any musculoskeletal or like, neurological conditions?
P: No.
D: Okay. And how about autoimmune conditions like rheumatoid arthritis or like Hypothyroidism or type 1 diabetes.
P: In my family history? I think there is some. There's definitely some diabetes on my father's side, but other than that, I think one of my aunts on my mother's side had a hysterectomy for cancer.
D: Okay. All right. And was it endometrial cancer?
P: I'm not sure actually, but she. I just know that she had her uterus removed.
D: I see. All right, and so next I wanted to just move to the physical exam portion. And so just first inspecting the hand and wrist. Do you. Do you see any swelling or redness?
P: No.
D: How about any changes to temperature? Do any of the joints feel warm?
P: No.
D: And are you seeing any muscle atrophy or any deformities of any of the joints in the hand?
P: Maybe like just a little bit. Like, I feel like I've lost some of like the fat pad just right near my thumb.
D: I see. Okay. And is there any areas of your hand over, like, any of the joints or over the wrist that if you press, you feel pain?
P: No.
D: Okay. And are you able to move your wrist with a full range of motion?
P: Yeah, I can move it.
D: Okay. And is there any. So that. Then the next test, I'll just ask you to just tap on the kind of base of your palm there with your index finger and middle finger of your left hand. And when you do that, do you feel any burning or tingling?
P: Yeah, I definitely do.
D: Okay. So that would be a positive Tinel sign. And do you get any. So if you flex both of your wrists so that the back of your hands are pressing against each other, and if you hold that position, do you start to get symptoms of the burning and tingling?
P: Yeah, I do feel it as well there.
D: Okay. All right. So that was everything I wanted to ask about and check today. Did you have any questions?
P: No, I just wanted to know how I can fix this.
D: Yeah, certainly. So it's sounding like carpal tunnel syndrome, which the differential would be something like a radiculopathy coming up from the neck, which you're not having any neck symptoms. And the positive Tinel sign and positive phalen sign are highly suggestive of carpal tunnel syndrome, along with the nighttime symptoms and the burning and tingling sensation you're experiencing. So to help with this, one of the first things that can be done is trying to use, like, wrist splints at night to try to keep your hand in a neutral position. But also, depending on, like, if there is inflammation there, NSAIDs might help a little bit, like ibuprofen or things like that. But the majority of the therapy will be kind of an activity modification. And if symptoms don't improve over a period of time, then surgery could be a potential option as well.
P: Okay, sounds good. Okay.
