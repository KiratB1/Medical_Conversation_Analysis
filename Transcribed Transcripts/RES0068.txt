D: Okay. All right. Yeah. So those are all the questions I had for you today. Do you have any questions at all for me?
P: No. What do you think I have?
D: Yeah. So from the symptoms that you're describing, it does seem more like a sinus issue. Like there's sinuses behind your face. And what can happen is if you get an infection, like, all the mucus and everything can build up and increase the pressure. The pressure you're feeling underneath your face is because of a sinus infection, Most likely. And usually. It's usually like a viral infection that can go away on its own. We usually ask patients. Patients to try the nasal rinses and then some oral knee congestions or. Have you tried any antihistamines?
P: No, I haven't.
D: Okay. Any. Okay. So no antihistamines. Okay. So what we can do for you today, it seems most likely that you have a sinus infection. It can be bacterial with yellow discharge that you're having as well. So we can give you some antibiotics. So we'll give you some amoxicillin. Sure. So it's only been three days, though, right, since you're having these symptoms?
P: That's right.
D: Okay. And you haven't had any high fever or anything like that. Have you measured your temperature?
P: I haven't. I haven't, no.
D: Okay.
P: I don't feel hot, though.
D: Okay. Since it's been three days, what I'm gonna do is still give you some antibiotics. So amoxicillin, and then we'll see, like, after you finish that dose, how you feel. And we'll set up another appointment for when you're. We can do, like a phone appointment or a clinic appointment when your dose is done. Does that sound good?
P: Yeah, that sounds great. Thank you.
D: Okay. You're welcome. And hopefully you feel better.
P: Thank you.
D: Take care. You too.
