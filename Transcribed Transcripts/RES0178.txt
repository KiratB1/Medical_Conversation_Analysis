D: Okay. And those are all the questions that I had for you today. Did you have any questions of your own?
P: No, I just wanted to figure out what this was.
D: Okay. Yeah. So it sounds. Or actually I should start by saying we should get a Covid swab on him just in case it is Covid, because some of his symptoms overlap with those symptoms of COVID You should hear back in about 24 to 48 hours. With the results of those swabs. And in the meantime, it could be another viral infection that's going around at this time of year. And from the sounds of it, you said he has a fever, he's coughing, and he has a runny nose, and he has muscle aches. It could also be the flu. Regardless of what kind of viral viral infection he has, the best way to manage it right now is just supportive care. So making sure he's hydrated, he's eating foods with a lot of nutrition, and just keep an eye on his symptoms. If it gets worse or if it's very severe and he has focal neurological deficits like weakness or seizures, take him to the ER Right away. How does that sound?
P: Yeah, that sounds good. Thank you.
D: Yeah, no problem.
