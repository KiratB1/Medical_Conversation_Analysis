D: Okay, all right. Travel. And where do you live right now?
P: So I just live in a student house with.
D: Oh, yeah, sorry you said that.
P: Oh, no problem.
D: I guess I'm trying to get at. Are there any old carpets, you know, reasons for you to believe that there may be a lot of mold or asbestos or anything like that in the house that may be making your symptoms worse.
P: It's mostly like hardwood or like kind of ceramic flooring. So there aren't many carpets and things like that. So I guess. No.
D: No. Okay. All right. And those were kind of all the questions that I had. Did you have anything to add or anything you wanted to discuss today?
P: No, I was just wondering what might be going on now. It's been a few days.
D: Yeah, for sure. So it sounds like you may have a viral infection and because your symptoms overlap with those of COVID we will do a Covid swab on you just to rule that out.
P: I.
D: But from the sounds of what your symptoms are, it is most likely to be a common cold, in which case you can just manage it with a lot of hydration, nutrition, good sleep. But if your symptoms get worse or they're not going away after a couple weeks, or you're having neurological deficits like weakness or seizures, you should get help from the er. Does that sound okay?
P: Yeah, for sure. I haven't had any symptoms like that so far, so that's good.
D: Yeah, for sure. All right. Take care.
P: Take care. Thank you.
