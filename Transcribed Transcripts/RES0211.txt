P: I have allergies. Usually in, like, the spring and the fall.

Otherwise I'll take, like a Claret. And this isn't like, this is maybe around. Like, this is just before they normally start. So I don't really have them right now.
D: Okay.
P: Probably like in a few weeks they'd be really bad.
D: Now, do any of these allergies caught make it difficult to breathe or you feel like your face is swelling up?
P: Like, it feels like a little bit, like, plugged up and like, what's that called? Like, post nasal drip. But I don't really feel like I can't breathe.
D: It's just like a little stuffy, eh?
P: Yeah, exactly.
D: And these shots that the allergist gave you, how often would you get those?
P: Those are the ones that I'd have, like, once. Usually like once a week for a little while, like in the winter before.
D: Okay, so you don't carry an EpiPen with you?
P: No, no, they said it's not like one of those allergies. It's just like. It's just like the seasonal ones, but they're just bad.
