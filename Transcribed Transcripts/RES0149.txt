D: How may I help you?
P: Hi. I just developed, or I guess I just started having difficulties with breathing starting this morning. It was just very odd. I was fine yesterday night, and then just this morning, I've had a really hard time breathing. And, yeah, I thought I should come in and get it checked out. I don't know what's going on.
D: Yeah, certainly. And so, like, did this shortness of breath wake you? Like, did you wake up like this and had to kind of sit up to catch your breath or when did the shortness rest start?
P: It was kind of after I woke up and I was sort of just walking around that I noticed that I was feeling short of breath. Just walking around, which was so weird, you know, that. That doesn't really happen to me.

P: No.
D: Okay. And have you had any wheeze?

D: Okay. Is this pain when you take a deep breath in?
P: Yeah, I guess so. Yeah.
D: Where do you feel the pain?
P: It's kind of on my right side.
D: Okay. Does the pain, like, radiate anywhere or do you feel it just in the one spot?
P: It's just. It's just in that one spot. It's just this sudden and, like, the stabbing sensation when I'm, like, taking a breath in. Actually, now that I think about it, it's kind of there even when I'm, like, breathing normal, but it's not as bad. When I take a deep breath, it's like, really, really bad. Or when I. Yeah, when I, like, cough or, like, I'm laughing or something, it just gets really bad.
D: And when did you first notice this pain?
P: Kind of late this morning.
D: Okay. Have you tried anything for the pain?
P: I don't know. It's just. I just try not to take deep breaths. I'm just trying to just take a normal breath and try not to talk too much and. Yeah, just, like, not doing anything that worsens the pain.

D: Okay, great. All right, so you've been experiencing this chest pain when you breathe in deeply since this morning, as well as some more difficulty breathing and some left pain, left leg pain with some swelling. Have you been after travels as well? Have you had any other symptoms?
P: No, I don't think so.
D: Okay, so that was all I wanted to ask today on history and before went on to the physical exam. I want to check vital signs and have a listen to your heart and lungs and measure the diameter of your shins as well. But it'll be important to get some imaging of your lungs to assess whether or not there's a pulmonary embolism, because that would be one of the more life threatening or potentially complicating causes of what's going on right now.
P: Sure.
