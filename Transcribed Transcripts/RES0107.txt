P: It does affect his sleep. Sometimes he doesn't. Like, he just. The itching really bothers him, so he can't. He finds it hard to fall asleep. That's like, usually that's when I give him the medications to help them fall asleep.
D: Okay. Okay. And is he up to date with all his immunizations?
P: Yep.
D: Okay. Any family history of asthma, eczema, or something called allergic rhinitis?
P: I have asthma.

P: I used to get allergies as well as a child.
D: Oh, I see.
P: Be very similar. Lots of sneezing.
D: And were you ever. Did you ever take like an allergy test?
P: No, I didn't think about it. I just never, like, my parents didn't take me to get that testing done.
D: Okay. How about your son? Has he been allergy tested?
P: No, but I feel like he probably should.
D: Yeah. Okay. And then does anyone at home smoke? No. No. Okay. Do you have any, like, old carpets, dust, mold or asbestos at your place? We got all of.
P: We got our carpets removed two years ago. That actually helped with the symptoms. And we tried. We removed the curtains as well. And we've used blind, so. Yeah, I don't think so. I don't think there's any spores or things like that.
D: Okay, good. Is he an otherwise healthy child? Like, developmental wise, like, he's growing, gaining weight. Okay. Like, he's. His motor skills and, like, social behaviors are all up to par with his peers?
P: Oh, yeah, he's doing great.
D: Okay. Okay, good. Those were all the questions that I had for you today. Did you have any questions of your own?
P: No.
D: No. Okay. So for him, it sounds more in keeping with something called allergic rhinitis than an infection. But because his symptoms do overlap with that of COVID we'll probably get him a swab anyways. And those results should come back in 24 to 48 hours. In the meantime. Rhinitis. Allergic rhinitis is caused by allergies to certain things. So we can get him allergy tested, and that'll give us a better understanding of, like, what his triggers are and things. The way to treat that is to avoid those triggers, those allergens. And if his symptoms are persistent, we'll prescribe him also, like, an intranasal corticosteroid. And there are second line treatments as well, like antihistamines and leukotriene receptor antagonists. But the. Those are like, second line. We'll see how he does with the inhaled corticosteroids at first. How does that sound?
P: Sounds great.
D: Okay, great.
P: Thank you.
D: No problem.
