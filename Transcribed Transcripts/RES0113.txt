D: Any recreational drugs?
P: No.
D: Okay. All right, well. And you said that you don't have a family history of any.
P: No. Yeah.
D: Okay. All right. I think that's all the questions I had for you. So looks like you've had a fever, cough and a headache that's gotten worse over the past few four days. And your headache's pretty bad, a seven out of ten. And it could be that you have some sort of an infection, including with COVID being one of the possibilities. And so continue to take Tylenol and monitor your fever if it continues to get worse or you notice that your symptoms are just not getting better, you should come back. We'll also do it Covid. We'll also send in a request for Covid Swab. And we'll ask you to quarantine for the next 14 days. And try to stay away from your husband and daughter as well, if you can, at home. And I guess a couple of other questions that I wanted to ask and I should have asked earlier. Do you have any stiffness in your neck or any difficulties moving your neck?
P: No, nothing like that.
D: Okay. All right. And do you have any questions?
P: No, that's it.
D: Thank you so much. Okay, great.
