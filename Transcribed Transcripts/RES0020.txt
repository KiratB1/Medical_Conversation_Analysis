D: All right. And then any cancer that runs in the family?
P: Cancer? No. No.
D: Okay. I think that's all I wanted to cover on the history today. Was there anything else you'd like to tell me that I was. That I maybe didn't ask about?
P: No, I think you asked me all those other questions. I'm just wondering, what do you think I have?
D: Yeah, certainly. So it could possibly be something related to the heart. And sometimes, especially people in your age group who have diabetes can have chest pain and symptoms that could be nonspecific. And so we will check that for sure. We'll get an ECG and some lab work with the troponin and also a chest X ray so that we can investigate for that. And also the chest X ray can help us look to see if you have something going on in your lung like a possible pneumonia or maybe a viral infection as well, which could include something like COVID 19. So we will be ordering a PCR nasal swab as well to test for that. And so in the meantime, because we'll be doing that test, it requires self quarantine for 14 days. So if possible, that would mean distancing from your husband in the home as well for that 14 day period, but that the results should come back from that test within the next several days. And sorry, also if it is positive, we will have to notify public health as well so that the appropriate contact tracing can be done.
P: Okay, well, thank you very much.
D: You're very welcome. We'll get the investigation started now.
P: Sure, sounds good.
