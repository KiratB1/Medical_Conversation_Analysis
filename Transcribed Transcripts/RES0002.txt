P: My sister, so his aunt has asthma.
D: Okay. And does anybody. Is there any congenital diseases that run in the family?
P: No.
D: Okay. How about any genetic diseases?
P: No.
D: Okay. And so it's sounding like we'll wanted to do a workup for his symptoms right now, for breathing heavily and with the fever that's concerning. For a type of infection. And with being under three months, it would warrant some investigations. So we'd want to check. Do some blood tests and check his cerebrospinal fluid as well to make sure that there's no infection in the brain, I guess, and we'll kind of go from there.
P: Sure. Yeah, that sounds good.
D: Okay. In the meantime. Yeah. We'll give you some inhalers and keep the oxygen on to help with the lungs and the breathing. And then keep monitoring for how he's doing symptomatically.
P: Okay. Thank you.
D: You're welcome. Was there anything else that I missed to ask about?
P: No, I don't think so.
D: Okay, that sounds good. So if there was nothing else that you wanted to share. So we'll get that started, and I'll be back shortly.
P: Okay, Sounds good. Thank you.
