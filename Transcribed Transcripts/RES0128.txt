D: How can I help you?
P: Hi. So I brought my 6 year old son in today because yesterday during soccer practice he developed this pretty severe cough and he couldn't catch his breath.
D: Okay, so this happened yesterday, you mentioned?
P: Yeah, it happened. Yeah, yesterday afternoon.
D: Okay, so you mentioned a cough. Is it a harsh barky cough or is it more like a muffled cough?
P: I would say it's more muffled.
D: Okay. And is it a dry cough or is it bringing up any phlegm?
P: Dry, dry.
D: Okay, so no blood in the. With the coughing?
P: No blood.
D: Okay. And does he sound wheezy to you?
P: He does, yeah. He's still sounding a little bit wheezy now. It's better than last night. He was a bit more wheezy last night.
D: Okay, how about short of breath? Does he sound short of breath at all?
P: No, that's gotten a bit better. That resolved about an hour like after he stopped playing, but he was short of breath yesterday.
D: Okay, and have you tried anything for his cough or his shortness of breath or wheezing?
P: No. You haven't?
D: No. Okay. Does he have a fever at all? No.
P: He doesn't mention anything about feeling hot or having chills either?
D: No. Okay. And any rashes that you've noticed?
P: No.
D: No weight loss over the past few weeks?
P: No. He's been gaining weight.
D: Well, okay, good. Has he had a stuffy nose or runny nose?
P: I'm. Well, sometimes he will get a runny nose. He takes like reactant or Claritin or some sort of allergy pill for that sometimes, but that's usually like the changing of seasons. That'll happen more often.
D: Okay. Okay. Does he have any allergies?
P: Yeah. To mostly environmental triggers. I'm not sure what the specific things are, but I just know it gets worse. Maybe in the spring. Springtime.
D: Okay, and does he have asthma?
P: He's never been diagnosed, but he has had or his sister has asthma.
D: Okay. Okay. And has he. Have you noticed any changes in his vision or hearing?
P: No.
D: No. Okay, how about changing his smell or taste?
P: No.
D: No. How about like, does he seem like he has any chest pain?
P: No, he hasn't mentioned anything like that.
D: Okay. Any dizziness or fainting spells?
P: No.
D: No confusion or memory loss?
P: No.
D: Okay, how about confusion? Sorry, you said no headaches.
P: No headaches?
D: No. Okay. Any joint pains, muscle aches?
P: No.
D: Okay. And how about changes to his bowel movements?
P: No, everything's been normal there.
D: Okay, how about nausea or vomiting?
P: Nothing like that.
D: Okay. And okay, so you mentioned he has asthma. He might have asthma. He was never formally diagnosed Is he otherwise healthy or does he have any long standing medical conditions?
P: He's been healthy. Yeah, I know he did have, like, he would get some itchy skin when he was a bit. When he was like a baby, but he hasn't needed any creams for that for a long time.
D: Okay, so he might have something like eczema, you think?
P: Yeah, he definitely. Yeah, I think he did.
D: Okay. Okay. And is he on any medications right now?
P: No, he doesn't take anything right now.
D: Okay. During his mom's pregnancy with him, were there any complications?
P: No, she was healthy and he was born at term with a normal weight and able to go home relatively quickly, so there weren't any concerns.
D: Okay, that's good. And was he healthy, like after birth?
P: Yeah, so he's. He's done well. There weren't really any concerns with development or growth and he's doing well in school.
D: Okay. Okay, good. How about. So was he a full term baby and was it a vaginal delivery?
P: Yes, both.
D: Okay. Any complications during the delivery?
P: No.
D: Okay. And he didn't need any hospitalizations, like right after birth as a newborn?
P: No.
D: No. Okay, good. Is he up to date with all his immunizations?
P: He is, yeah.
D: Okay. And you mentioned that he may have some seasonal allergies. Any other allergies that you know of?
P: Not that I know of, no.
D: Okay. You mentioned that his sister has asthma. Any other lung conditions or heart conditions that run in the family?
P: No, nothing like that?
D: No. Okay. Okay. And does anyone at home smoke?
P: No.
D: No. Okay. Any old carpets, dust, mold, asbestos, anything like that at home?
P: We took out the carpets and stuff when his sister was diagnosed with asthma, so it's good from that perspective.
D: Okay, good. And who lives at home with him?
P: So it's myself, his mom, and then his sister.
D: Okay. Okay. Any pets at home?
P: He's got a fish.
D: A fish. Okay. And has. Has he come into contact with anyone sick recently?
P: No, I don't think so. I mean, when? At school, they've been pretty diligent with, I mean, Covid and everything right now, so I think he's been. Okay, okay.
D: Has he traveled anywhere recently?
P: No.
D: No. Okay. Okay. Those were all the questions that I had for you today. Did you have any questions of your own for me?
P: Yeah, I was just wondering if my son had asthma as well and if, like, you need a prescription for inhalers.
D: Yeah. So we're gonna. Since he's never been diagnosed before, we're gonna do some investigations for him, just to start. So we can do. We can start by doing a pulmonary function test for him to see what his lung activity is like. So we'll start there. And then we'll also because you're saying he's short of breath, we'll take his oxygen saturation as well and maybe even do some, like, some basic blood work for him. And if it turns out he has asthma, which in this case I do strongly suspect, we'll prescribe him some bronchodilators, like a short acting beta agonist, as well as an inhaled corticosteroid, because his symptoms do seem somewhat severe this time around. And then I should also mention, because some of his symptoms overlap with that of COVID he will also get a Covid swab. And you should hear back about that in 24 to 48 hours. How does that sound?
P: That sounds good. Thank you.
D: All right. Great. Thank you.
