D: What brings you in?
P: Yeah, so I just came in today. I actually had asthma as a kid and I used to be on the puffers and it pretty much resolved by the time I was around like 18 years old. And I've been pretty good since then. I haven't even been really using the puffers for the last five years. But just recently, just during the winter, I started noticing some of my symptoms coming back. And now especially over the last few months, whenever I'm doing something like going to the gym or exercising, I do get that shortness of breath and I feel my throat closing in again. And recently, for the last, I would say a week, I've also been having some wheezing as well. So. Yeah, I just wanted to come back and make sure everything's alright.
D: Okay, sure. So just to rewind a little bit. When were you first diagnosed with asthma?
P: So I was diagnosed when I was, I think it was like when I was 13 years old.
D: Thirteen. Okay. And you've been using puffer since?
P: Yeah, so from then to like maybe When I was 18, I was using puffers, but. And then I continued using them on and off like the. Just the blue one whenever I needed it. But for the last five years I haven't even had to use any puffers at all.
D: Okay. Okay. So can you tell me a little bit about the symptoms that you're experiencing right now? Okay, so you said some shortness of breath. When did that start?
P: So, yeah, in the last, I would say two months. I've noticed it similarly to when I was younger, especially when I'm on the treadmill or running. I. I do feel I get short of breath very easily, but at rest I'm fine. I don't have any trouble. But I've noticed it for the last few months.
D: Okay. So it's mostly when you're exercising or with activities. Okay. And do you feel wheezy as well?
P: Yeah, in the last one to two weeks, I would say I'm also wheezing as well. Maybe mainly during, like if I. If I'm running or still with exercise, I feel myself wheezing. Yeah. So that's been an issue for the last couple weeks.
D: So once you stop activity, does your shortness of breath and wheeziness eventually resolve?
P: Yeah, yeah. So if I. I just have to kind of sit down and relax for a bit and then it goes away on its own.
D: Okay. How long does it last before it goes away?
P: Probably at least like, I would say 10, 10 to 15 minutes.
D: Okay.
P: Okay. Until it fully kind of Recovers.
D: Are you coughing as well?
P: Yeah, when I'm exercising. And that's when all of that happens. The wheezing, the coughing, but throughout the day. Otherwise I'm not coughing.
D: Okay. And when you cough, do you bring up phlegm or is it more like a dry cough?
P: It's mostly a dry cough. Sometimes I do bring up some white, clear, whitish material, but usually it's dry.
D: Okay. All right. And do you feel like your heart's racing?
P: No, no, nothing like that?
D: No. You don't feel like you're breathing a lot more than usual?
P: No, I don't think so.
D: Okay. Do you still have puffers at home?
P: I actually like. I haven't used them for a while, so I know I don't have any puffers.
D: Okay. Okay. Any weight loss recently? No, no fevers or chills?
P: No, nothing like that.
D: Okay. Any rashes or changes in your hair or skin to. Or nails?
P: I do, I do have just a eczema. Like I've had it for most of my life now, so especially during the winter, I do get some irritation, especially on my hands, so yeah, some rashes, but that's about it.
D: Okay. Any changes in your vision or hearing?
P: No, no changes.
D: Stuffy nose, runny nose? Changes in your taste?

D: Okay, so you mentioned you have you were diagnosed with asthma and eczema in the past. Any other long standing medical conditions that you have?
P: No, those are the only ones.
D: Okay. Any allergies?
P: I do have, I think I'd like just seasonal allergies. I don't know if I'm allergic to pollen or. Yeah. So in, during the springtime I get allergies and then during the winter now I'm getting some of these symptoms that I'm talking about, so. Yeah. But none to any medications that I know.
D: Okay. So you're not getting any nighttime symptoms and you're only getting daytime symptoms with activity, right?
P: Yeah.
D: Has this prevented you from going to work or school?
P: Yeah, so I just, just this past week I usually do my running like morning workout right before work.
D: Yeah.
P: And just one of the days after I worked out, I. I felt just terrible, was just coughing and Short of breath. So I just decided to take a day off work that day. But then I realized it kind of goes away on its own. So I. For the other days, I have been going to work.
D: Okay. Okay, good. All right. And then any medications that you're on?
P: Just. I'm on a. Just a. One of those steroid creams for my eczema.
D: Okay. Okay. Are you up to date with all your immunizations?
P: Yep.
D: Okay, how about family history of lung conditions or heart conditions?
P: No heart conditions, but yeah, asthma is pretty big in my family as well as eczema. Like, my mom has it, my sister has it, so yeah, asthma is pretty big.
D: Okay. How about cancers?
P: No, I don't think anyone in the family has any cancers.
D: Okay. And do you smoke?
P: No, I've never smoked. I'm pretty health focused and I can't even take if someone else is smoking, so. No.
D: No. Okay. Do you drink alcohol?
P: No, I don't drink alcohol. No drugs? Yeah, I'm pretty. I like to stay very fit and healthy, so nothing like that.
D: Okay. And have you been in contact with any sick people recently?
P: No, not that I know of. I live by myself in my apartment. I've been working from home. I work as a programmer and so I only go outside for run and stuff or groceries, so I haven't really seen anyone sick around me.
D: Yeah. And have you traveled anywhere recently?
P: No, I've mainly been at home.
D: Okay, good. And where's home?
P: Home is in Hamilton, Ontario, and I've just been. Yeah, working from home.
D: Okay. Do you live in a house? Apartment. Who do you live with?
P: I just live in an apartment by myself. I did have a roommate like that. Moved out just a couple of months ago, but yeah, right now I'm just by myself.
D: Okay. Okay. Any old carpets, pets, mold or asbestos in the house?
P: No, nothing like that.
D: Okay, good. So those are all the questions that I had for you. Did you have any questions of your own? For myself, yeah.
P: I was just wondering if I should go back on the puffers. I don't have any right now. I just don't know if my asthma has just come back.
D: Yeah. So we're gonna. What we're gonna do is we're going to do a pft, so pulmonary function test on you because it's been a while since you've had one of those done. And that's just to check how well your lung is functioning. So we'll do that. We'll also maybe get a chest X ray as well for baseline and depending on what those two come back as we'll probably get you to use your short acting beta agonist puffer again, and we'll also give you a long acting.
P: Okay.
D: As well as an inhaled corticosteroid. So, actually, you know what? We'll give you an inhaled corticosteroid and a short acting beta agonist because you can't use both the steroid and the lung. So we'll start with those two. We'll start with the short acting as well as inhaled cortisosteroid. And if we find that your asthma is just based on, like, exertion or like something called athletic asthma, we can also try something called cromolin instead. But we'll discuss that more. Right now, our priority is to get your symptoms under control. So we'll start with the short acting as well as the inhaled corticosteroid. How does that sound?
P: Yeah, that sounds good. Thank you so much.
D: Yeah, no problem.
