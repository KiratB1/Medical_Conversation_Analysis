P: No, it's a fairly new apartment.
D: Okay. Okay. Well, those are all the questions that I had for you today. Did you have any questions for me?
P: You don't think it could be Covid, Right? Like, my wife got tested, it was negative, So I was just a bit concerned about that.
D: Yeah, for sure. Honestly, some of your symptoms do seem to be overlapping with that of COVID especially the cough and fever. So we are going to do a Covid swab just to rule that out. So you will get those results in 24 to 48 hours. And you should isolate for 14 days because your symptoms overlap. And public health will be in touch with you if it's positive, just to do some contact tracing. But if it's not Covid, it could be another viral infection that's going around this time of year. So keep an eye on your symptoms. If they become worse, or if you're experiencing symptoms like neurological deficits or weakness or seizures or anything like that, get help from the ER right away. And if your symptoms are persisting beyond, like, seven days, seven to 10 days. Also, you should give us a call back to see what's going on, because it could be something like a bacterial infection, in which case we can give you some antibiotics. Does that sound okay?
P: Yeah.
D: Okay, great. Thank you.
P: Thank you.
