D: Okay. And. Okay. I think that's all I wanted to ask about today. Was there anything else that you wanted to tell me or maybe that I forgot to ask about?
P: No, I don't think so. Do you think I have Covid?
D: It's certainly possible. It will be something we test for. Although the symptoms that you're experiencing with feeling or having a fever, sore throat and not feeling well, with the muscle aches and fatigue, it's relatively nonspecific. So, as you mentioned, it could be something like the common cold that you've experienced in the past. So we can't rule that out either at this time, but we will do some investigations, including a nasal swab for Covid, and kind of go from there.
P: Okay, Sounds good.
D: All right, we'll get that started.
P: Great.
