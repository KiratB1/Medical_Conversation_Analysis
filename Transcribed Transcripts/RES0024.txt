D: Can you start by telling me what brought you in?
P: So, like, I don't really feel sick. I just. I lost. I can't. I. For the past two days, I can't smell anything. I can't taste any of my food. It's super weird. I, like, live with my boyfriend, and he was like, here, take a bite of this onion. And I, like, bit into it, and I literally didn't taste anything. Otherwise, like, I feel totally fine. I just heard that this happens sometimes with COVID and I'm just kind of worried that I have Covid.
D: Okay. For sure. I will. We will definitely look into that today. And you are right. It is a symptom that can occur with COVID but we'll want to make sure that it isn't something else. And so I want to just ask you a few more questions about how you've been feeling. So you said you haven't felt sick. So have you been experiencing any other symptoms?
P: I mean, I've maybe been a bit tired, but really, otherwise, no. I guess maybe I felt like a little trick, but I haven't actually been coughing.

D: Okay. Any reason. Reason for hospitalization?
P: No.
D: Okay.
P: I went. I'm sorry. I went to the emergency department. Like, when I had my peanut out, like, the first time, I realized I was allergic to peanuts, but that was it.
D: Oh, did you have an anaphylactic reaction?
P: Yeah, like, I was a kid, so I don't really remember that much, but that's when they told me I was allergic.
D: I see. Okay. So important to have the EpiPen then. For sure.
P: Yeah.
D: And so you mentioned that you were living with your boyfriend.
P: Yep.
D: Okay. And anybody else?
P: No, just us.
D: Okay. And has your boyfriend been sick at all?
P: No.

P: No.
D: All right. And then has anybody in the family had cancer before?
P: Like, my uncle. I'd like prostate cancer.
D: Okay. No. Breast cancer? Ovarian cancer?
P: No.
D: Okay. So that was all I wanted to ask about on the history today. Was there anything else that I maybe forgot to ask about?
P: I don't know. That's it.
D: Okay. So, yeah. With the symptoms of losing your spell over the last day, or so, we will certainly look into whether or not this is caused by Covid. And so that will require a nasal swab test for that. Usually, results are coming back now within 48 hours, hopefully, but still, we're required to self isolate now for the next 14 days after your symptoms are gone. So we will let you know when the results come back from this test for.
P: Okay, thank you.
D: All right. You're welcome.
