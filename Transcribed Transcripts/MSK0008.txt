D: Okay, great. And any chance that you could be pregnant?
P: No.
D: Okay. And in the family, are there any musculoskeletal or neurological conditions?
P: No.
D: Okay. And so that was everything I wanted to ask on history. So for the physical exam, when inspecting the knee, are you seeing any joint effusions or joint swelling or ecchymosis or bruising?
P: It looks. It's not a bruise. It looks red, and I would say it's a little bit swollen on the medial aspect only.
D: Okay. Is there any muscle atrophy?
P: No.
D: Okay. And is there any misalignment or joint deformities?
P: No, not that I notice.
D: Okay. And on gait or walking, is there any limp or antalgia?
P: No.
D: If you're able to walk normally.
P: I'm able to walk normally. It hurts, but I think I'm walking. Okay.
D: Okay. And next, is there any changes to temperature, like, does the joint itself feel hot?
P: No.
D: Okay. And are there any areas of the joint line itself of the knee that is pain to palpation?
P: It. Just the medial part of it, like the. I guess, where the ligament would be.
D: Okay, so just let me. Okay. Any pain over the patella?
P: No.
D: Any pain over the tibial tuberosity or patellar tendon?
P: No.
D: Any pain over the fibular head or the lateral part of the knee?
P: No.
D: Any pain in the calf or the thigh muscles?
P: No.
D: Any pain in the hamstring muscles?
P: No.
D: Okay. And is there any pain to a, like, various stress of the knee.
P: To the various. I guess there would be pain if I press down in that area.
D: Okay. And is there any joint. Yeah, joint laxity or pain to like a valgus stress of the knee?
P: Yeah. So when I press, when I do that, it hurts on the medial aspect but not the lateral aspect.
D: Okay. And does it feel as though there's some, like, the joints opening more when you put the valgus stress?
P: A little bit? Yes.
D: Okay. And is there any instability moving the tibia anteriorly if you're to, like, pull it outwards?
P: No.
D: And how about if you pulled the tibia posteriorly? Any instability?
P: No.
D: Okay. And is there full range of motion of the knee?
P: Yes.
D: And full range of motion of the hip and ankle?
P: Yes.
D: Okay. And then do you have any, like, numbness, tingling or muscle weakness?
P: No.
D: Okay. And any sensory changes to the skin?
P: No.
D: Okay. And reflexes aren't normal. Okay. So I think that was everything I wanted to ask and kind of go through on the physical exam. Did you have any other questions or anything that maybe I forgot to mention today?
P: No, that was it. Just what can I do about my knee?
D: Yeah. So right now it's sounding like this could be an MCL or medial collateral ligament strain or injury. And so these types of injuries are usually treated conservatively, like with things like NSAIDs or anti inflammatories to help the pain and swelling. If the pain, depending on how severe it is, it might be useful to use maybe crutches for a day or two to try to help let the pain subside and allow you to be able to do some physical therapy exercises like strengthening the quadriceps and hamstring muscles. But typically injuries that are lower grade will heal within two weeks. And if it's more severe, it could take a bit longer. And although it's most likely an MCL injury that you're describing, it could be a medial meniscal injury as well, or possibly even a bursitis at the medial aspect of the knee. But the treatment to start with will be the same and maybe we'll get a knee X ray if things aren't improving.
P: Okay, that sounds good. Thank you.
