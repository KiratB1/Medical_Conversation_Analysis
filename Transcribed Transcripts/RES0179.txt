D: What brings you in?
P: I've had this cough. It's been going on now for the last six months or so and been losing some weight as well. I've lost, I think, like, 20 or 30 pounds in the last six months.
D: Oh, okay. Yeah. That's a lot of weight. So the weight loss, you said 20 to 30 pounds?
P: Yeah, yeah. Like just over 200, and I'm in the 170s now.
D: Okay, so that was in the past six months. When did the cough start?
P: Well, I've had a cough before, like a smoker's cough. And so that's been like, a couple of years. But that's just a cough that I would have in the morning and it would just go away. But, I mean, around six months ago, I started having this cough all day.
D: Okay. And is it a dry cough or is it a productive cough?
P: It's been dry.
D: It's been dry. Okay.
P: Yeah.
D: So no blood or sputum?
P: No, no bladder sputum.
D: Okay. And have you been feeling short of breath at all?
P: I have, yeah. The shortness of breath has been, like, similarly getting a bit worse over the last six months.
D: Okay. All right. And is there wheeziness as well?
P: No wheezing.
D: Okay. How about chest pain?
P: Yeah, I've had this kind of, like, dull, kind of aching pain that I've had. Kind of just on the right side of my chest. Yeah, it's kind of aching and not that bad, but uncomfortable.
D: Okay. And is it a sharp pain or is it a dull, achy pain?
P: It's more like dull.
D: Okay. And is it always there or is it worse with, like, exertion?
P: It's always there.
D: Okay. I'm sorry, you said it was at the center of your chest.
P: More kind of on the right side.
D: Okay. Does it get worse with, like, deep breaths?
P: Not really. No.
D: No. Okay. How about when you lean forward?
P: No.
D: No. Okay. And have you ever been worked up for the chest pain in the past, like, to rule out heart attacks, blocked arteries, anything like that?
P: Yeah, actually, I've had a stress test about a year ago, and the results of that were normal.
D: Okay. Okay, good. And do you ever feel like your heart's racing?
P: No, I haven't had anything like that. I mean, like, sometimes I can get palpitations because I have afib or atrial fibrillation, but it doesn't really. Yeah. Affect me that. That much.
D: Okay. And how about shortness? Sorry. How about dizziness or fainting spells?
P: Nothing like that?
D: No. Any calf pain when you walk a lot?
P: No.
D: No. Okay. Any Fevers?
P: No.
D: No. How about fatigue?
P: Not really. No.
D: No. Any rashes?
P: No.
D: Changes in your vision or hearing?
P: No.
D: Smell or taste?
P: That's been normal.
D: Okay. Runny nose or stuffy nose?
P: No.
D: Sore throat?
P: No.
D: Tenness in your bowel movements?
P: No diarrhea.
D: How about blood in your stool or constipation?
P: No constipation and no blood in the stool.
D: Okay. Nausea or vomiting?
P: No.
D: Appetite changes?
P: No, my appetite's been okay. That's why I was really shocked at the weight loss.
D: Okay. How about changes in your urine?
P: No. I mean, sometimes I can have. I mean, a harder time to go because as an old guy, I have large prostate, I think they said, but, I mean, that's been okay.
D: Okay. How about headaches?
P: No headaches.
D: Numbness or tingling?
P: No numbness or tingling.
D: Confusion or memory loss?
P: No.
D: Okay. Joint pains or muscle aches, and sometimes.
P: I can get, like. My knees will hurt, but I think that's just arthritis.
D: Okay. Yeah. All right. And are you otherwise healthy? You mentioned that you have afib and prostate issues. Anything else?
P: Yeah, like high blood pressure and. Yeah, just high blood pressure.
D: High blood pressure. Okay. Have you ever been diagnosed with something called copd?
P: No, I was tested for that with, like, the breathing test. I had to blow into a tube, but, yeah, they said that I didn't have it.
D: Okay. Okay. When were you worked up for that?
P: That was probably, like, I don't know, five to ten years ago now.
D: Okay. All right. And are you on any medications?
P: Yeah, I take one for high blood pressure and I think a beta blocker as well for heart rate and afib.
D: Okay. Yeah. Okay. And are you up to date with your immunization?
P: I am, yeah.
D: Okay. Any allergies?
P: No allergies.
D: Okay. Family history of lung or heart conditions?
P: I think, like, my uncle had lung cancer, and I think I've had a couple family members who've had lung cancer, actually, but they've. Well, they've all been smokers.
D: Oh, I see. Okay. Do you know what type of lung cancer they got?
P: No, I'm. I'm not sure.
D: Okay, no problem. And. Okay, so I think you mentioned that you smoke. How much do you smoke, and for how long have you been smoking?
P: I smoke about a pack per day. And I guess probably been smoking now for, I mean, I guess, like, 60 years almost, maybe longer. And before that? There was a point I was smoking like, two packs a day.
D: Oh, wow. Okay. Well, it's good that you cut down. Yeah. All right. And do you do any other recreational drugs?
P: No.
D: No. Okay. And how about alcohol. Do you drink.
P: One or two beers every day?
D: Every day. Okay. And what's your living situation like right now?
P: Yeah, so I live with my wife in a townhouse.
D: Okay. Okay. All right, that's good. Any reasons to think you have, like, old carpets, dust, asbestos, mold, anything like that in the house?
P: No, I don't think so.
D: Okay.
P: Yeah.
D: All right. Any pets?
P: No pets.
D: No pets. Okay. Have you been in contact with anyone sick recently?
P: No, I don't think so.
D: No. Okay. How about travel?
P: I've been. Yeah, we've been at home.
D: At home. Okay. Okay. Well, those are all the questions I had for you. Did you have any questions of your own? For myself.
P: No. I was just really worried that I could have lung cancer.
D: Yeah, for sure. So that is quite high on my differential right now, just because of your age, your smoking history, and just the way you're presenting. So we're going to do a couple things. We're going to do a Covid swab just to rule that out. You should hear back in about 24 to 48 hours. But we will do investigations for lung cancer. So we'll start by doing a chest X ray just to look for a mass or effusions. And then from there, if we think that are signs of cancer, we can do a CT as well. We can, like, stage with a PET CT after we take a biopsy and send it off for pathology. And that should give us more answers as to if you have cancer and if you do have cancer, what type of cancer, so that we can talk about treatment for plans and kind of what the prognosis is with those particular types of cancers. How does that sound?
P: Yeah, that sounds great. Thank you so much.
D: Okay. Yeah, no problem.
