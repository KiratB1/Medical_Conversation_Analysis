P: It's just his right ear.
D: Just his right ear. Okay. And have you noticed that it's like swollen, red or warm?
P: No, I don't see any swelling or redness at all.
D: Okay. Okay, good. And have you taken a look inside his ears?
P: Yeah, I tried to take a look with flashlight. I couldn't really see too much.
D: Okay. Yeah, that's fair. And you mentioned he's had a runny nose too. When did that start?
P: Yeah, so that kind of like last week he was recovering from. I think it was just a cold and he had a runny nose and just was a bit congested. But then over the last week, it kind of just resolved. But then this week he started having just this ear pain.

D: Okay, good. Does he have a sore throat at all?
P: No, not that he's told me. He's still eating things, like, and I don't think he's having any trouble with eating anything, so I don't think so.
D: Okay, that's good. Has he had a cough?
P: Actually, yeah, he did. He did start coughing like yesterday, but it like just a few times a day. I don't know if it's because of this or like, what else might be going on.
D: Okay, and you said for the past few days he's had the cough?
P: Yeah, I Think just maybe started yesterday.

D: Okay. And has he traveled to anywhere recently?
P: No. Like, he has mainly just been inside his home.
D: Okay. Has he ever had ear pain before?
P: He did have a similar pain, I think when he was, like, around 3 years old, but it happened with his left. Left ear, not the right one.
D: Okay. Was he prescribed any medication?
P: Yeah, he was given, like, a course of antibiotics at that time. I forgot what it was called, but I think at that time it was much worse. I don't know if he was just younger and couldn't tolerate it, but I think he also had a fever at that time.
D: Okay. Okay. And any other ear infections outside of that one time?
P: No, I think only. Only that one I can recall.
D: Okay. All right. Is he otherwise healthy?
P: Yeah, otherwise he's healthy. No. No other conditions or anything like that?
D: No hospitalizations or surgeries?
P: No.
D: Okay. And is he on any medications?

D: Okay. Is he up to date with all his immunizations?
P: Yeah, all his immunizations are good.
D: Okay. Any allergies?
P: Not that we know of so far.
D: Any family history of lung conditions or heart conditions?
P: No longer heart conditions. Just. There is. His father does have, like, celiac disease. I don't know if that's related at all.
D: Okay. How old was he when he was diagnosed with celiac?
P: Fairly young. I would say in his 20s.
D: Okay. Okay. All right, well, keep an eye on it in him. Like, if he has any changes in his bowel movements or if he's getting severe abdominal pain after eating certain foods with gluten. You can get him checked up for that as well.
P: Okay.
D: And then in terms of where he lives, does he live with you and your partner?
P: Yeah. So it's just he's a. He's an only child. Lives with me and my husband, and also we have, like, a pet dog.
D: Okay. Do you live in an apartment or in a house?
P: We live in. It's like a. Like a condominium.
D: Okay. Okay. Any old carpet, mold or asbestos in the building?
P: No, no, nothing like that. It's fairly well kept.
D: Okay. And is he otherwise? Like, developmental wise? He's okay. There's no past history of, like, developmental disorders, anything like that?
P: No. His. No issues from, like, when he was younger? Like, no complaints at all. Think he was doing the same as every other child.
D: Okay. No complications during your pregnancy with him? No complications during the actual delivery and then when he was a newborn?
P: No, no complications. It was a. Just a vaginal birth at 39 weeks, and we didn't need to stay in the hospital at all afterwards.
D: Okay, good. So those were all the questions that I had for you today. Did you have any questions of your own?
P: Yeah, I don't know if, like, last time we did get some antibiotics. I don't know if he needs them right now or. What would you recommend?
D: Yeah, so I'm gonna have to take a look into his ears first before I can come up with, like, a management plan for him. So once I do, if I see if his tympanic membrane has been perforated or I see pus in there, we'll prescribe him, like, 10 days of antibiotics. We can give him either amoxicillin, or if he has bad reactions to penicillins, we can give him cefuroxime. And then if it doesn't seem to have any systemic symptoms. So if he has systemic symptoms like fever, which we'll check for today, and if he's, like, been really ill and he has, like, a middle ear effusion or bulging tympanic membrane, again, we'll give him antibiotics for 10 days. But if his tympanic membrane is just bulging a little bit, or if he has some middle ear fusion but no systemic symptoms, like no fevers and he seems to be fine otherwise, we'll reassess him in 24 to 48 hours to see if he's better. And if he's not, again while prescribing antibiotics. How does that sound?
P: Yeah, that sounds good. Thank you.
D: Okay. Yeah, no worries.
