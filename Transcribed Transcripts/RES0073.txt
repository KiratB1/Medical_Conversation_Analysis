D: Would you mind by starting with what brought you in?
P: Yeah. So over the last week, I've just been feeling some symptoms of. So it kind of first started with just like, I had, like, a runny nose, and then. So that was around, like, five days ago. And then it turned into just a lot of congestion, like, around my nose and, like, my throat. And now over the last two days, I've been just feeling so much pressure around. Around my nose, around my jaw. So I've been getting a lot of pain there as well.
D: Okay. Is your nose still running?
P: Yeah, I'm still getting some discharge, and I also feel like I'm getting some dripping at the back of my throat, too, especially when I wake up.
D: Okay, and could you describe the discharge? Is it clear, yellow, greenish?
P: It's fairly clear and sometimes, like, a bit white, but like, it's. It's not like, green or yellow.
D: Okay. And have you felt that it's difficult to breathe in through either of your nostrils? Like, it's obstructed?
P: Yeah, so I. At night, sometimes I have to, like, turn because one side of my nose gets difficult to breathe from, and then it kind of balances out on the other side. So I do have some obstruction.
D: Okay. And have you had any changes to your sense of smell?
P: Yeah, so just in the last three days when the congestion got really bad, I started losing the ability to smell.
D: Okay. Have you had any changes to your sense of taste?

P: I did. I did kind of have a runny nose last week as well, so probably like eight days ago, and. But the runny nose has continued a little bit, but really got worse five days ago. But all these other symptoms just happened in the last few days.
D: Okay. And you have pain. Is it. You feel it in your jaw or do you feel it in the front of your nose or.
P: Yes, I would say mainly over the cheeks. It can kind of go near the front of my teeth as well. So, like, I would say, like, mostly around the cheeks, jaws, and up to the front of my teeth.
D: Okay. And do you grind your teeth at all at night, or have you had, like, TMJ issues before?
P: No, nothing like that. I think it's not so more like on and around my teeth. It's more so just right below my nose, above my teeth and just around my cheeks.
D: Okay. So no Pain in your mouth or anything like that?
P: No, not inside my mouth.
D: Okay. Have you had any fevers or chills?

P: No.
D: Okay, and so you didn't have a cough or a sore throat, but have you had any wheezing?

D: And how's your energy been? Have you any fatigue?
P: It's been. It's been mainly okay. Just maybe sometimes difficult to get to sleep with all the congestion. But I don't think it's. My energy's been affected too much.
D: Okay. And sorry to go back to this. I don't think I asked. Did you have noticed any discharge from your eyes or any eye redness?
P: Not discharge, but yeah, maybe a little bit of redness.
D: Okay. Have your eyes been itchy?

P: No, not that I know of.
D: Okay, so you don't experience any symptoms like this when the seasons change?
P: I. I don't think so. I have had this happen to me, I would say, like, once before. It happened, like, two years ago. Yeah, it was pretty similar.
D: Okay, and did you have any. What was done at that time.
P: At that time, it kind of just went away on its own. It got better. Like, I feel it's definitely worse this time, but at that time, I didn't even go to the doctor. It kind of just went away.
D: Okay, I see. And any reasons for hospitalizations?
P: No hospitalizations. No.
D: Any surgeries?
P: Nope.
D: All right. And can you tell me whereabouts you're living currently and who you're living with?
P: Yeah, so I'm currently living in an apartment by myself just outside of London.
D: Okay. And anybody that you've been around who's had any symptoms?
P: No, not that I know.
D: Okay, so no sick contacts. And have you traveled anywhere out of the city or province?
P: No, I've tried to stay home besides going to work. I just work at the grocery store. Besides that, nowhere else.
D: Okay. And anybody, any of your co workers have any symptoms or any co workers being off sick?
P: No, we're pretty careful right now with the pandemic.
D: I see.
P: Yeah, no, that.
D: That's great. Okay. And do you smoke cigarettes?
P: No, I quit just a couple years ago.
D: Oh, that's great. It's not. Yeah, it's not easy to quit, so that's awesome. And do you drink alcohol?

D: All right. How about any cancer in the family?
P: No, no, no cancers.
D: Okay. I think that was everything I wanted to ask about today. Was there any other symptoms or anything else that you wanted to make sure I knew about today?
P: No, I think that's all. I just didn't know if I needed any medications or if I needed to get tested. I just wanted to make sure.
D: Yeah. So we'll certainly check your temperature to see if you have a fever, and if you do and it's high enough, that will increase the chance that you have a bacterial sinusitis, and if so, with some of your symptoms, including the discharge, obstruction, loss of smell, and facial pain. That all fits the picture for it. And also you had a period where you felt a little bit better and then worse again. So that might require antibiotics, but we will check your temperature and go from there.
P: All right, sounds good. Thank you so much.
D: Thank you.
