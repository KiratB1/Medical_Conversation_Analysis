D: What brings you in?
P: I just came in today. I think I broke my leg or something. It's something that was. I heard a snap. I was in just a dance class, and we have, like, these long dresses. It was a traditional dance class, and my foot slipped right onto it, got caught in my dress and it just kind of slipped and I felt right on my. My leg kind of twisted and I fell down and I just stayed down. I knew something was not right and something was broken.
D: When did this happen?
P: Just, I would say like an hour ago.
D: Hour ago. Okay. Are you able to bear any weight on it at all?
P: No, not really. I had to come in the ambulance.
D: Okay. Okay. And if you were to localize this pain, where exactly is it?
P: It's pretty much my whole lower leg is painful, but I think where it looks like it broke is like the middle part of my lower leg.
D: The middle part. Okay, middle part of your lower leg. So kind of where your shin.
P: Right leg, yeah.
D: Okay, so in the shin area. Okay. Have you tried anything for it? I know it's only been an hour.
P: No, nothing. I just, like. I just wanted to make sure I keep it as still as possible. I didn't want to even try anything.
D: Okay. Yeah, that makes sense. If you were to describe this pain, would you say it's sharp, dull, achy, throbbing?
P: It's like sharp and throbbing. It's like, probably one of the worst pains that I've felt in my life.
D: Okay. Okay. And 1 to 10. 10 being the worst pain ever. How bad is it?
P: A ten? For sure.
D: Ten. Okay. Have you. So you said you've never experienced this before? Do you feel like it's getting worse, the pain? Or has it been pretty much the same since it started, or is it getting better?
P: I would say it's the same. It's like I'm in as much pain as I was earlier.
D: Okay. Okay. And so. Yeah. Okay. Do you know how you felt like on the floor? Like, did you go, like, leg first or was it. Did. You're kind of like the mechanism of your fall. Did you break the fall at all with your arms?
P: Uh, no, I didn't break it. Kind of just so I was kind of. I feel like when I was slipping, it was. At first my leg was hyperextended, but it kind of just felt like it snapped and it went straight down. So there was some kind of turn twisting as well as some hyperextension, but it just kind of slipping on my dress and then just straight down.
D: Okay. Okay. Otherwise, do you have any pain elsewhere on Your body?
P: No.
D: How about any numbness or tingling in the area?
P: I do feel some numbness, tingling just below where it happened, but it, like, comes and goes.
D: Okay, and then how about. How about any, like, feelings of, like, losing sensation or feeling cold in that area?
P: No, I can feel everything in that area.
D: Okay.

P: So my mother has something called osteoporosis.
D: Okay. Yep.
P: But that's. That's all that I can think of.
D: How old was she when she was diagnosed with that?
P: Probably in her 50s. Late 50s, I would say.

P: I think one of my aunts has ovarian cancer.
D: Okay. Okay. How old was she when she was diagnosed with that?

D: Okay. Okay. And then have you been in touch with anyone sick recently?
P: No.
D: No. Okay. Have you done any travel recently?
P: No.
D: Okay. Those are all the questions I had for you. Did you have any questions of your own or anything you wanted to add before we move to the physical exam component?
P: No, I just want to get this fixed as soon as possible.
D: Okay, that sounds good. Yeah. We'll try our best.
P: Thank you.
D: Okay, so now, looking at your legs, like, side by side, do you notice any redness or swelling in your right leg compared to your left?
P: Yeah, it's all swollen and red. This looks so much different than my other leg.
D: Okay. Yeah. Do you notice any obvious, like, breaks in the skin?
P: No, there's no breaks in the skin. But, like, when I fell, like, I. I can definitely see, like, the bend. There was, like, a bend in the bone, so I definitely do think it's broken.
D: Okay, and do you notice any, like, bony pieces that are pushing on the skin?
P: No.
D: No. Okay. Any bruises in the area?
P: Yeah, the whole area seems bruised up and angry.
D: Does. Besides the bruising and the misalignment, do you notice any other obvious deformities, Any muscle atrophy in the area?
P: No.
D: No. Okay, and then placing your hand on one leg compared to the other, does it seem warmer?
P: Yeah, I feel like it's warmer.
D: Okay, and then I'm gonna try to get you to do some movements. Can you move your right leg at all? Like, can you flex and extend your knees?
P: No, not. Not at all. I'm too scared to try.
D: Okay, and how about weight bearing? Are you able to stand up at all on that?
P: No, I just. I just got them to call the ambulance. I knew. I knew it was just not possible.
D: Okay. All right. I guess those are all the questions that I had for you. I think you may have a tibial fracture, so we'll start with some X rays to be sure and to try to take a look at, like, where the fracture is and how we can approach that, because everything is swollen and angry down there. We'll probably try and apply a splint until the swelling goes down, and then we can refer you to an orthopedic surgeon for a surgical. For the surgery itself. So that could involve, like, you know, them doing, like, an intramedullary nail plates and screws and, like, some sort of fixation. But after the surgery, your fracture will probably take about four to six months to heal completely. So in that period, we can talk about, like, pain management and physiotherapy as well, just to keep the muscles in that area strong and to increase your range of motion. Does that sound okay?
P: That sounds good. Thank you so much.
D: Okay. Yeah, no worries.
