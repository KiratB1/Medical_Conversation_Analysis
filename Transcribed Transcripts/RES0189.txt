D: How may I help you?
P: So I've been having a lot of trouble in the last two weeks of, especially this past week of just a lot of shortness of breath. I'm getting a lot of coughing as well and producing a lot of material. And also I think I might have been having a fever this week as well.
D: Okay, the shortness of breath, is it happening at rest or exertion and how much exertion?
P: I think it's happening mostly on exertion. Usually I'm able to walk around the house, no issues, go up and down stairs. But right now I'm pretty limited. I can't really go up and down stairs without getting really short of breath. I can't even walk from the bedroom to the kitchen without becoming shortness of, like, short of breath.
D: Okay. Okay. And when did that change happen?
P: So I would say one week ago is when this all kind of started.
D: Okay. And has it been getting any better, worse, or staying the same?

I was diagnosed with COPD in my 60s. It's probably like 10 years ago, and. But this seems to be just much worse than my copd.

P: No, I think that those are all the questions I had and everything was covered.
D: Okay, so the next steps for now, I think will be to.
P: Start.
D: Well, we'll get a physical exam and your vital signs and get some investigations because it is sounding like a COPD exacerbation with the increasing and the changing sputum, the increasing frequency of cough and the exertional shortness of breath, along with wheezing and kind of this chest discomfort that you're experiencing. And so this will require some antibiotics as well, and depending on the severity of symptoms, possibly some steroids as well to help with the inflammation.
P: Okay, that sounds good. Thank you.
