D: How may I help you?
P: Hi, I'm here with my three year old daughter. She's been holding her elbow awkwardly and she seems like she's in pain. So I was just wondering if like something happened to her elbow and if you can fix it.
D: Yeah, for sure. Okay, so is she holding her arm, like in any particular position, like with her elbow kind of flexed or is her arm extended?
P: It seems kind of flex. She's holding it awkwardly, she's not stretching it.
D: Okay, and when did this start? When did you first notice?
P: I noticed this yesterday.
D: Okay, and has she been holding her arm kind of like this the whole time?
P: Yeah, there's just like a slight bend to it. It's not fully straightened, it's not fully like fully flexed. It's just kind of hanging at her side.
D: Okay, and has there been anything that's made the pain worse?
P: No, I don't think so. I think. No, I think she's just been holding it awkwardly like that, I'm assuming so it doesn't cause more pain.
D: Okay, and is the pain sharp, burning or achy?
P: I think it's sharp, the sharp pain.
D: Okay, and does the pain radiate anywhere else, like pain in the hand or wrist or pain up into the arm or shoulder?
P: I don't think so.
D: Okay, and has there been like. Was there anything that happened around the time that you first noticed her holding her arm like this, such as a fall or maybe like somebody pulling on. On her hand, like swinging her from her arm or anything like that?

P: No.
D: How about any heart or lung conditions?
P: No.
D: Okay, so I'll ask you to just have a look at her elbow now and let me know if you're seeing any swelling or redness.
P: Okay, so the elbows look fine. Neither elbow appears red or swollen.
D: Okay. And are you seeing any muscle atrophy or any joint Deformity or malalignment?
P: No, I don't see that. I also actually, it might be slightly. It looks a little bit awkward the way she's holding it, so I can't tell if it's misaligned.
D: Okay. And any skin changes over the elbow?
P: No.
D: All right. And if you were to press over various portions of the elbow, are there any areas that cause pain, like the lateral side, medial side, or anterior, posterior?
P: It hurts. She's in pain whenever I touch anywhere near the elbow area.
D: Okay. And is there any pain with movement?
P: Yes. Whenever I try to bend it or straighten it out all the way, she complains of pain.
D: Okay. How about moving the wrist or shoulder?
P: No, that's fine.
D: Okay. So that was everything that I wanted to ask about and look for on the physical today. Did you have anything else that perhaps I forgot to mention that might be important?
P: No, that was kind of it. I just was wondering how we can fix her elbow.
D: Yeah, certainly. So it will be. So we'll want to get an elbow X ray, but typically to fix this type of injury. So currently I'm thinking this could be a. Like a radial head subluxation and possibly a radial head fracture, but most likely a radial head subluxation where there's a mechanism of pulling on a child's arm. And it's just that what could happen is the part of the radius, which is a forearm bone, can pull out of the ligament that's holding it down just because of the structures. They're not yet fully matured and strong, and somebody who's that young. And so it will cause pain, reduced range of motion at the elbow, and you won't really see much swelling or redness. And with just a physical exam maneuver, you can reduce it and put the head of the radius back into place, and things will be usually back to normal. But if there is a fracture, which we'll look for on X ray, then the pain may last a little bit longer, but immobilization of the arm is not required, and most kids will regain full mobility in. In a short time after the reduction.
P: Okay, that sounds good. Thank you.
