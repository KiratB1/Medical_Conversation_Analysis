D: And have you thought of quitting at all?
P: Yeah, I've been trying. It would be nice to. I was thinking of maybe get talking about a prescription for helping quit or something like that today because I was feeling like this is causing some of my cough and shortness of breath.
D: Yeah, well, it's really great that you're thinking about quitting. We can definitely help you with some resources and some medications. Have you tried anything before that I should know to help you quit?
P: I've tried nicotine patches and gum, but that's it.
D: Okay. So yeah, there's like other options as well. There's. That you can take now. Have you heard of Champix?
P: I did hear. I did hear of it actually. Yeah. So one of my friends tried it and it worked well for them. So, yeah.
D: Okay. Yeah, so we can. If you're wondering about that, I can give you some information on that medication, like a whole package for you and then we can discuss if that. That could work for you.
P: That sounds great.
D: Okay. Sweet. And other than smoking, do you use any recreational drugs like marijuana?
P: No, I don't.
D: Okay. And do you drink alcohol?
P: I'll have one or two beers on the weekend.
D: Okay. All right. So yeah, that's pretty much all the questions I had right now. It seems that your symptoms, you do have that cough and shortness of breath, and it's been chronic, but now you're coughing up some blood as well. So that is definitely something that's concerning. And we want to make sure there's nothing going on. So we will get a chest X ray for you and see if we can find anything there. And are you still producing, like, the bloody sputum?
P: Yeah, that's been coming up daily still.
D: Okay. So if you think you can produce that, we can even take a sample of that as well and see if there's any presence. The one thing that we're concerned about with some of your symptoms and a long history of smoking as well is lung cancer. So, yeah, we will do a chest X ray, get some cytology done as well. And then once we have that, in the future, we may need to maybe do a biopsy, but right now we'll just do a few of the first things that I mentioned and then go from there.
P: That sounds good. Thank you.
D: You're welcome. Take care. Bye.
