D: Okay, good. Is there a particular reason you take these CBD edibles?
P: Helps me sleep.
D: Okay, if it's specifically to help you sleep, we can actually try and see if there are other options for you. There are pills, like they are sleep aids or even things like melatonin that can help regulate your sleep. So we can revisit other options for you if you're open to that as well.

D: Okay, good. And I apologize, but I would like to clarify three more symptoms with you. Do you have a fever? Did you say you felt like you had a fever earlier?
P: Maybe I'm feeling a little hot, but it's been really more the cough and shortness of breath that's been bugging me.
D: Okay, well, we can take a temperature today just to make sure. And have you been feeling like you have night sweats or chills?

D: Okay, and how about any weight loss over the past few months?
P: No, my weight's been stable.
D: Okay. All right, good. So that brings us to the end. Do you have any questions or concerns that you would like to clarify before we end the interview?
P: No, nothing today. I was just really hoping to get whatever this is sorted out.
D: Yeah, you know, right now it looks like it sounds like it could be an upper respiratory viral illness, so that includes Covid. So we will do a swab for you and then send it off to the lab for PCR results. In the meantime, because you have symptoms that overlap with COVID symptoms, we do Encourage Isolation for 14 days until your or until your symptoms are gone. Sorry. And until your symptoms are gone, even if they're gone, we do suggest isolating for 14 days just to make sure you're not a carrier or could spread Covid. So we do encourage that, and that includes from your husband if possible. We will get those results in a day or two. If they are positive, we will send your results to public health, who will be in touch with you to do some contact tracing to see where you may have gotten it from. If it's not Covid, it could be other viral illnesses that are going around this time of year. And if your symptoms aren't getting better on their own and there's reason to suspect you may have a bacterial infection or bacterial pneumonia, we will follow up with you and possibly prescribe antibiotics. How does that sound?
P: Yeah, that sounds like a great plan.
D: Okay, great.
P: So.
D: I will see you at the next appointment.
P: Thank you.
