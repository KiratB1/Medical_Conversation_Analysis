D: Do you want to tell me what brought you in today?
P: Yeah. So for the past two days, I've noticed that I can't smell things as well as I used to be able to smell them. And I seem to have lost my sense of taste as well. And I have this mild dry cough. I'm just worried it's Covid.

P: Yes, for two days.
D: Okay. Okay. Have you ever had anything like this before?
P: No. No, Nothing like this.
D: Okay. When you say you feel like you've lost sense of taste and smell, is it totally gone or do you taste a little bit, or how is that working for you?
P: The smell isn't totally gone. I can still smell something if it smells really, really bad. And then I can taste really, really salty foods, but I can't taste normal things. Like I can't taste a banana.

P: Pretty good. Yeah. We're doing things online now.
D: You haven't really been out of the house?
P: No.
D: Okay. Okay. I think that's all my questions for now. I definitely like to get you a COVID test just because symptoms are consistent with some common Covid symptoms. So basically that means that we would do a swab. It might not come back for a day or two. You definitely have to self isolate between now and when you get the results back. Potentially even if it's negative, longer if you're still having symptoms.
P: Yeah.
D: Otherwise there probably. There might be a couple other tasks we want to do. We might have more questions when we come back. So I'll go over this with the doctor that I'm working with today, but just wanted to give you a heads up of what to expect next. Did you have anything else you wanted to tell me that I didn't ask you about or any questions?
P: No. Thank you so much.
D: Okay, well, thanks for coming in today. We'll definitely get you taken care of shortly.
P: Thank you.
D: Okay, thanks.
