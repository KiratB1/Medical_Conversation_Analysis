D: Okay. And has anyone been sick recently or had Similar symptoms?
P: No.
D: Okay. All right. Has anyone in the family ever had any diagnosis of asthma, eczema, allergic rhinitis? No, no, nothing like that. Okay. All right. So, yeah, those are all the questions I had for you today. Do you have any questions or concerns? So, yeah, so we'll be doing a couple. We'll do a physical examination. I want to see. Examine what the rash looks like. And there's many things that can cause a rash. There's viral infection that can cause some of his symptoms. The symptoms he's having mainly seen viral with the dry cough and runny nose. And then you can have rash as well. One thing I forgot to ask actually, is, is he fully immunized?
P: He. I guess he didn't get all his immunizations done earlier. He did get them a little bit later. So we came from Syria as refugees, but I'm thinking he got all his immunizations when he came to. When we moved to Canada.
D: Okay, and is he complaining of joint or muscle aches at all? No, no, nothing like that.
P: No.
D: Okay. All right. So, yeah, we'll do like a full physical examination. And if it's more just a viral, it'll be something that have to monitor and do supportive care for. But if it's anything else, we might need to do further investigations and we'll just do a Covid monitoring as well as some of the symptoms overlap with COVID symptoms and you will get the results back in 24 hours to 48 hours and then further instruction from public health.
P: Sounds great.
D: All right, well, take care. I'll talk to you soon.
