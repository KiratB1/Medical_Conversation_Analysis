P: Hey, I just have this cough that's been like, really bothering me.
D: Okay, how long have you had that for?
P: Like, in the past few days, it's been really, like, gross, and I've been coughing up this, like, gunk. But I've had it through. I've. I've honestly had a cough for like, three months. It's just like, sometimes it's like there and sometimes it kind of goes away. It feels like it keeps coming back.
D: Okay, have you had any chest pain?
P: No. Like, it kind of hurts when I cough now, but not. Not like on its own.
D: Okay. Have you noticed any fevers at home or fevers at all in the last couple days?
P: I've been feeling hot at night in the past couple days, but I didn't actually take my temp.
D: Mm. Okay. Have you had any night sweats? You wake up, the sheets are soaked?
P: No, not that.
D: Nothing like that. Okay, have you noticed any unexplained weight loss over the last little while?
P: No.
D: So you go on the scale, you lost a few pounds, but you haven't been trying to?

P: Like, maybe. Maybe three days.
D: Three days ago. And you said before that you kind of had this dry cough before. When did you first notice that? Three months ago, you said.
P: Yeah, I was. I. I do like it, like, sounds silly, but I do like a pole dancing class just for exercise. And I was like, at my class and I kind of just started to. To, like, feel like I was like a little coffee. And I don't think there's anything special that was just like, when I noticed it.
D: Okay, Anyone at the class sick at that time?
P: I don't think so. Like, it's a really long time ago. I don't really remember.
D: Got it, got it. Anyone sick near you or around you in the last couple of weeks?

D: So no nausea, no vomiting?
P: No, none of that.
D: You don't have a stiff neck at all, do you?
P: No, no, I don't.
D: Okay, but how about other parts of your body? Any pain, tenderness anywhere?
P: I don't think so, no. Like, I'm a little tired now. Like the cough was like, maybe for like a month. It's been kind of waking me up a little bit. So my, my sleep hasn't been great, but I don't think it's like I have like pain. I'm just like tired.
D: Okay, so the cough does wake you up at night?
P: Yeah.
D: Does it wake you up every night?
P: Yeah, like pretty well for like the last. Not like all three months, but probably the last month.
D: Okay. All right. I'm just going to move on, talk a little bit about you and the past. So any issues that you've seen a doctor for before?
P: Just like eczema.
D: Okay. And do you take anything for that?
P: Just like moisturizing creams. Like my family doctor back home said like a couple times when it was really bad, she would give me one like to go get at like shoppers. But right now it's not bad, so I just have just like a regular cream.
D: Got it. Ever been hospitalized before?
P: No.
D: Okay. Any surgeries?
P: No.
D: Okay, so aside from the eczema, sounds like you're pretty healthy, eh?
P: Yeah.
D: Okay. Do you have any allergies?
P: I think maybe, maybe cats, because I, I don't have one, but sometimes I've noticed stuff, but I've never like, it's never really been too big of an issue.
D: Okay, so you've never taken any medications or got stung by a bee and had any trouble breathing or eating a certain food? No, nothing like that. Okay. Are you taking any medications right now?
P: No.

P: No.
D: Got it. All right, and we'll just kind of going over things. So it sounds like you've had this cough, or a cough for a little while, but it's only become bad in the last three days. You're waking up at night and you're kind of bringing up this foul. Or not this foul, but this kind of greenish sputum, but it's no blood in it, and otherwise you don't have any constitutional symptoms. So I will go review your story with the doctor. Is there anything else you'd like to bring up with them before I go?
P: I don't think so. I just, like. I hope I just can feel better because I've been missing, like, my exercise stuff because I feel like it's, like, coughing and it makes it hard to do well.
D: Got it. Got it. We'll see what we can do. Okay. Thank you very much.
P: Okay, thanks.
