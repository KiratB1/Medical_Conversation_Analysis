D: Okay. Okay. Well, those are all the questions that I had for you. Did you have any questions or anything that you wanted to bring up that I haven't covered?
P: No, that's it. I was just, I mean, concerned about COVID after I've been hearing about this new variant and stuff on the news, so. A little bit worried.
D: Yeah, for sure. We will definitely take a swab from you today and we'll see what the results are. You should hear back in about 24 to 48 hours. But in the meantime, you should self isolate for 14 days. And if it's not Covid, if that comes back negative. And yeah, some of your symptoms also sound like other typical viral symptoms, so you could have one of the common strains that's going around this time of year. So for that, just. You should just do some supportive care, you know, staying hydrated, eating well. And if your symptoms become worse, you're running a really high fever, you have any neurological symptoms like weakness or seizures, then you should seek help from the er. How does that sound?
P: That sounds good. Thank you.
D: Okay, great. Thank you.
