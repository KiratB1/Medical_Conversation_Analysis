D: How may I help you?
P: I'm here because I've had some numbness in my right hand and doesn't seem to be going away, so I thought I should get it checked out by you.
D: Yeah, certainly. So when did this exactly start?
P: It's been pretty gradual. I would say over the past month or two months is when I first noticed it, but the numbness is definitely worse now than it was at the start.
D: Okay, and where is this, the pain and numbness? Where are you feeling it exactly?
P: It's particular. It's the worst on my thumb and index finger.
D: Okay. Do you feel it on your ring finger or. Sorry. Or your middle finger?
P: There's a little bit on my middle and ring finger, but it's like. It's very, very mild.
D: Okay. And, like, how are the symptoms constant or are they intermittent?
P: I would say it's somewhat constant, but it's worse when I'm trying to, like, hold a steering wheel or using my phone or, you know, reading a book.
D: Okay, I see. And is there anything that you do at those times to try to help get the symptoms to go away?
P: I guess I, like, shake out my hand or. Yeah. Try to put pressure on those numb areas.
D: Okay. Just flicking the wrist or anything like that. Does it help?
P: Maybe slightly.
D: Okay. And, like, how would you describe the pains in your hand? Like, dull, achy, sharp.
P: I would say the pain is more like a tingling sensation. So I guess the tingling is like a sharp feeling. I wouldn't call it so much pain as I would just, like, tingling and numbness.
D: Okay. Okay. And is there anything. So you mentioned sort of the driving and using your phone. Are there any other activities that make it worse?
P: Recently, I found it's hard for me to hold things in my right hand. So, like, if I'm trying to open up a jar, like, it's hard for me to hold it, and sometimes I find, like, it'll just fall out of my hand.
D: Okay, so you're, like, dropping items and stuff?
P: Mm, yes.

P: There's rheumatoid arthritis in the family, but that's about it.
D: Okay, but you don't have any other joint swelling or pains, right?
P: No.
D: Okay, and so next I would like to just do a physical exam and for the first part, I'll ask you to just have a look at the hand and wrist. And are you seeing any swelling, erythema, or redness or like any muscle wasting or. Or atrophy?
P: So in my right hand, I guess the, you know, the fleshy part of your thumb just above your wrist that seems to be, I guess, atrophied compared to my left hand.
D: Okay. Okay. So the muscle bulk is reduced there. Okay. Are you feeling any temperature changes, like does the any areas of the hand or wrist feel warm or hot?
P: No.
D: All right. And are there any areas, if you put palpate that cause pain, like over the wrist or any of the joints?
P: No pain? Yeah, no pain.
D: All right. And are you able to flex and extend your wrist?
P: Yeah, I can do that.
D: All right. And how about making a fist and then also extending your fingers back out?
P: That hurts. Or like, that causes the tingling.
D: Okay. Any issues with, like, moving your elbow or your shoulder?
P: No.
D: Okay. And if you take your opposite hand with just your kind of pointer finger and middle finger and just really tap right near the wrist crease, called the Tinellis test, and you tap there, do you feel any reproduction of symptoms?
P: Yeah, that causes the tingling.
D: Okay, so your positive Tinellis test. And if you kind of place your wrist so that, like, the backs of your hands are facing each other so that your wrists are flexed downwards and your wrists are flexed and your fingers are pointing towards the ground and you just hold that position for a period of time, do you feel any pain?
P: I get a little bit of tingling.
D: Okay, so that would be a positive valence test as well. And range of motion of the neck. Do you have any problems with that or any pain there?
P: No.
D: Okay. I think that was everything I wanted to ask about and check on the exam. Did you have any questions for me?
P: No, no questions. Thank you so much.
D: All right. You're welcome. Yeah, so it sounds like this could be carpal tunnel syndrome. And so we may depending on send for kind of like nerve studies to confirm the diagnosis and things that you can do in the meantime would be use like a splint or. Yeah, trying to use like nighttime splints and activity modification as well.
P: Okay. Yeah, that sounds good.
