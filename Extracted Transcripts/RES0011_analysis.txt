2. Travel-related illness or exposure leading to symptoms such as night sweats, feeling cold, and potential infectious etiology.
3. Chronic conditions like diabetes and high blood pressure may be exacerbating the current symptoms.

**Plan:**
1. Order lab work to assess for infection markers and rule out any underlying issues.
2. Provide fluids for hydration and Tylenol for symptomatic relief.
3. Monitor closely for any worsening symptoms and follow up with lab results to guide further management.

Follow-up appointment recommended for review of lab results and reassessment of symptoms.
