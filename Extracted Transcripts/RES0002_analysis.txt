**List of symptoms:**

- Fever
- Rapid breathing
- Yellow sputum
- Decreased urine output

- Fussiness
- Inconsolability

**List of possible diseases or illnesses:**
- Bronchiolitis
- Upper respiratory viral infection

**SOAP Note:**

**Subjective:**
A 2 1/2-month-old infant presented with a cough, fever, rapid breathing, yellow sputum, decreased urine output, decreased appetite, fussiness, and inconsolability for the past two days. The patient's mother mentioned a history of similar symptoms last month, diagnosed as a viral infection or bronchiolitis, which resolved with puffers.

**Objective:**
- Vitals stable, on 2 liters of oxygen
- Wheezy breathing noted
- Noisy or whistling sounds during breathing
- Decreased wet diapers
- Decreased appetite
- Fussy and inconsolable behavior

**Assessment:**
1. Differential diagnosis:
   - Bronchiolitis
   - Upper respiratory viral infection
   - Pneumonia

2. Past medical history of viral infection or bronchiolitis with hospitalization for breathing support suggests a predisposition to respiratory infections.

**Plan:**
1. Perform blood tests and cerebrospinal fluid analysis to investigate for infection.
2. Initiate inhalers and maintain oxygen therapy for respiratory support.
3. Monitor the patient's symptoms and response to treatment closely.
4. Educate parents on monitoring for worsening symptoms and follow-up care instructions.

Follow-up appointment recommended for further evaluation and management.
