**List of possible diseases or illnesses:**

- Autoimmune process affecting the lungs
- Lung cancer

**SOAP Note:**

**Subjective:**
The patient reports experiencing worsening breathlessness and a dry cough for the past two years. The breathlessness is mainly exertional and can reach up to an intensity of 8 out of 10.

**Assessment:**
1. Differential Diagnosis:
   - Pulmonary fibrosis
   - Autoimmune lung disease
   - Lung cancer
   - Asthma
   - COPD (less likely due to no smoking history)

**Plan:**
1. Order chest X-ray and pulmonary function tests to evaluate lung function and assess for any structural abnormalities.
2. Consider further imaging studies such as CT scan of the chest if indicated.
3. Conduct blood tests to assess for autoimmune markers and inflammatory markers.
4. Referral to a pulmonologist for further evaluation and management.
5. Monitor symptoms closely and follow up for review of diagnostic results and treatment options.
