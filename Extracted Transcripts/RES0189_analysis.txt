**Assessment:**
Likely COPD exacerbation given the patient's history of COPD, worsening exertional dyspnea, cough with yellow sputum, wheezing, and chest discomfort. Differential diagnosis includes pneumonia, bronchitis, and respiratory infection.

**Plan:**
1. Conduct physical examination and vital signs assessment.
2. Perform investigations to confirm diagnosis, including chest X-ray and possibly sputum culture.
3. Start antibiotics for possible infection.
4. Consider prescribing steroids based on symptom severity to reduce inflammation.
5. Discuss smoking cessation with the patient for long-term management of COPD.
6. Follow up with the patient to monitor response to treatment and adjust management as needed.
