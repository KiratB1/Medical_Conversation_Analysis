**SOAP Note:**

**Subjective:**
The patient presents with severe pain in the left knee that started a few hours ago. The pain is described as stabbing, with swelling, redness, and warmth in the knee. The patient reports limited movement in the knee and rates the pain as 9/10. Additionally, the patient has been feeling feverish for the past day.

**Objective:**
- Swelling, redness, and warmth observed in the left knee
- Patient has difficulty weight bearing and walking, requiring a wheelchair
- Pain reported on movement and palpation of the knee
- No other joint or muscle pain reported
- No skin changes or rashes observed
- No fever measured during the visit

**Assessment:**
Based on the patient's history and symptoms, the likely diagnosis is septic arthritis, considering the sudden onset of knee pain, swelling, redness, warmth, and fever. Cellulitis is also a differential diagnosis given the patient's history of skin infections.

**Plan:**
1. Perform blood work to assess inflammation markers and CBC.
2. Conduct a joint aspiration of the left knee to analyze synovial fluid for infection.
3. Start the patient on antibiotics immediately.
4. Consider hospital admission for further monitoring and treatment.
5. X-ray may be needed to evaluate the knee joint.

Follow-up appointments and monitoring will be necessary to track the patient's progress and response to treatment.
