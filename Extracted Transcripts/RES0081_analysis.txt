**List of symptoms:**
- Wheezing
- Difficulty falling asleep
- Irritability
- Decreased appetite
- Shortness of breath
- Cough

**List of possible diseases or illnesses:**
- Asthma exacerbation
- Respiratory infection
- Allergic reaction
- Bronchitis

**SOAP Note:**

**Subjective:**
The patient, a 5-year-old boy named Dave, presents with worsening asthma symptoms over the past few days. His mother reports persistent wheezing, difficulty falling asleep, irritability, decreased appetite, shortness of breath, and a cough that started approximately two days ago. She notes that his symptoms have not improved with the use of his usual inhalers.

**Objective:**
- No reported sputum production, blood in cough, sore throat, painful ears, chest pain, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, urinary problems, diarrhea, constipation, skin changes, rashes, muscle aches, or joint pains.
- No eye redness, discharge from eyes or nose.
- No recent exposure to sick individuals or travel history.
- Family history includes the mother having high blood pressure, but no other significant medical conditions.

**Assessment:**
1. Asthma exacerbation: Given the history of asthma, the presence of wheezing, shortness of breath, and cough, along with a known trigger of cold air, an asthma exacerbation is likely.
2. Respiratory infection: Differential diagnosis includes a possible respiratory infection contributing to the symptoms.

**Plan:**
1. Initiate treatment with inhaler medications, including Ventolin, and potentially add steroids if necessary.
2. Consider the need for antibiotics if signs of a bacterial infection are present.
3. Educate the mother on proper inhaler use and consider obtaining a spacer.
4. Monitor Dave's symptoms closely for any worsening, especially increased wheezing or respiratory distress.
5. Follow up with a physical exam to assess his vital signs and response to treatment.
6. Advise the mother to seek medical attention promptly if Dave's breathing worsens or if there is no improvement in his symptoms.
