**List of symptoms:**
- Holding elbow awkwardly
- Pain in the elbow
- Inability to stretch the arm fully
- Sharp pain in the elbow

**List of possible diseases or illnesses:**
- Radial head subluxation
- Radial head fracture

**SOAP Note:**

**Subjective:**
A 3-year-old female patient presents with a complaint of holding her elbow awkwardly and experiencing sharp pain in the elbow since yesterday. The pain does not radiate to other areas, and there is no history of trauma other than potential swinging by her father at the park.

**Objective:**
- Physical examination reveals no redness or swelling in either elbow.
- No muscle atrophy, joint deformity, or malalignment observed.
- Patient experiences pain upon palpation around the elbow area and with movement of the elbow.
- Range of motion limited due to pain in bending or straightening the elbow.

**Assessment:**
Based on the history and physical examination findings, the patient likely presents with a radial head subluxation, possibly a radial head fracture. The mechanism of injury involving swinging of the arms supports this diagnosis.

**Plan:**
1. Order an X-ray to confirm the diagnosis and rule out a radial head fracture.
2. If confirmed as a radial head subluxation, perform a reduction maneuver to relocate the radial head back into place.
3. Educate the caregiver on the condition, expected outcomes, and the importance of follow-up care.
4. Advise on pain management strategies and monitor for improvement in symptoms.
5. Recommend follow-up appointment for reevaluation and further management if necessary.
