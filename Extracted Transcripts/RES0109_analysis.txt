**List of symptoms:**
- Runny nose
- Cough (dry, comes and goes)
- Stuffy nose
- Decreased sense of smell
- Fatigue
- Body aches

**List of possible diseases or illnesses:**
- Common cold
- Viral upper respiratory infection
- Allergic rhinitis
- COVID-19 (ruled out with COVID swab)

**SOAP Note:**

**Subjective:**
The patient presents with a one-week history of a dry, intermittent cough that started before the onset of a runny nose. The cough improves with over-the-counter antitussive medication. The patient reports a stuffy nose, clear nasal discharge, decreased sense of smell, fatigue, and body aches. There is concern regarding COVID-19 due to recent exposure to someone who passed away from the virus.

**Objective:**
- Vital signs within normal limits
- No signs of respiratory distress
- Clear nasal discharge observed
- No signs of wheezing or chest pain on auscultation

**Assessment:**
1. Viral upper respiratory infection, likely common cold, given the patient's symptoms and history of recurrent colds.
2. Allergic rhinitis could also be considered due to the presence of a stuffy nose and clear nasal discharge.
3. COVID-19 is less likely based on symptoms and negative exposure history.

**Plan:**
1. Perform a COVID swab to rule out COVID-19.
2. Advise self-isolation for 14 days as a precautionary measure.
3. Supportive treatment recommended:
   - Stay hydrated
   - Take antipyretics like Tylenol for fever
   - Use analgesics like Advil or Tylenol for headache or sinus pressure
4. Monitor symptoms and seek immediate medical attention if symptoms worsen or neurological symptoms develop.
