**SOAP Note:**

**Subjective:**
The patient presented with a one-week history of cough, shortness of breath, feeling hot, fuzzy feeling, difficulty concentrating, confusion, yellow phlegm, wheezing, fever (38.5°C), runny nose with yellow discharge, chest pain, and fatigue. Symptoms have been progressively worsening over time.

**Objective:**
- Patient reports no history of shortness of breath, chest pain, or confusion prior to this episode.
- Chest pain is central and worsens with deep breathing.
- Patient has a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), diabetes, and hypothyroidism. Current medications include insulin, Synthroid, and aspirin.
- No recent travels or known exposure to sick individuals besides using a laundromat.

**Assessment:**
- Differential diagnosis includes pneumonia (bacterial or viral), upper respiratory tract infection, acute bronchitis, and influenza.
- Considering the patient's symptoms and history, pneumonia is the most likely diagnosis.

**Plan:**
1. Perform physical examination, including chest auscultation.
2. Order lab tests, including complete blood count and inflammatory markers.
3. Conduct a chest X-ray to assess for pulmonary involvement.
4. Isolate the patient and perform a COVID-19 test due to overlapping symptoms with pneumonia and public health guidelines.
5. Initiate treatment based on the confirmed diagnosis, which may include antibiotics for bacterial pneumonia or supportive care for viral pneumonia.
6. Monitor the patient's respiratory status, fever, and overall improvement during hospitalization.
