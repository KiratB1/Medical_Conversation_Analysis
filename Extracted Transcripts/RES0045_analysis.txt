2. Fever, fatigue, and muscle aches may indicate a systemic viral illness like influenza.

**Plan:**
1. Collect a swab for COVID-19 testing and send for PCR analysis to rule out infection.
2. Advise the patient to isolate for 14 days from family members and practice good hand hygiene.
3. Recommend supportive care including staying hydrated, getting adequate rest, and consuming nutritious foods.
4. Instruct the patient to monitor symptoms and return to the ER if experiencing high fever, neurological symptoms, or worsening difficulty breathing.
5. Follow up with the patient in 24 to 48 hours for test results and further management.
