2. Differential diagnosis includes viral respiratory infection, considering the worsening cough over three days.

**Plan:**
1. Recommend a COVID-19 test to rule out infection due to recent exposure at a family party.
2. Advise the patient to stay hydrated, eat well, and monitor symptoms.
3. Continue taking Tylenol for symptom relief and ensure adequate rest.
