**SOAP Note:**

**Subjective:**
The patient presents with a two-month history of pain in the left knee, describing it as stiff and limiting daily activities. The pain is mostly located in the front of the knee, deep within the kneecap. The pain has been gradually worsening, with stiffness lasting 15 to 30 minutes in the morning. The patient reports a dull, occasionally sharp pain exacerbated by activity. Additionally, there is some joint swelling in the left knee and a recent weight gain of 20 pounds.

**Objective:**
- Left knee appears slightly more swollen than the right knee
- No redness or temperature changes noted
- Tenderness along the joint line and increased pain over the patella
- Patient able to flex and straighten the knee, but experiences pain
- No pain over thigh, hamstring, or calf muscles
- No antalgic gait or significant limp observed
- No issues with hip or ankle movement

**Assessment:**
Based on the patient's history and physical examination findings, the likely diagnosis is osteoarthritis of the left knee. The presence of joint pain, stiffness, swelling, and limited range of motion are consistent with this condition. The recent weight gain may also contribute to the worsening symptoms.

**Plan:**
1. Encourage the patient to stay active but pace activities to avoid exacerbating pain.
2. Recommend Tylenol for pain relief and consider NSAIDs for acute flare-ups.
3. Suggest the use of topical agents like Voltaren for localized relief.
4. Discuss the possibility of a steroid injection if symptoms persist.
5. Monitor the patient's weight and consider weight management strategies to reduce stress on the knee joint.
6. Follow up with the patient to assess response to treatment and consider further interventions if needed.
