**Subjective:**
The patient presents with a wet cough that started within the last day, shortness of breath, yellowish-green sputum with a bad taste, worsening shortness of breath over the past twelve hours, smelly phlegm, faster heart rate, and nausea.

**Plan:**
1. Order a chest x-ray to evaluate for signs of pneumonia or aspiration.
2. Conduct laboratory tests to assess for infection markers.
3. Initiate antibiotic therapy based on chest x-ray and lab results.
