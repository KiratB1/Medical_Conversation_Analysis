**Assessment:**
1. Suspected community-acquired pneumonia based on symptoms of fever, grunting noises, coughing, and increased chest movement while breathing.
2. COVID-19 infection cannot be ruled out due to overlapping symptoms.

**Plan:**
1. Perform a COVID-19 swab to rule out infection.
2. Conduct tests including temperature monitoring, oxygen saturation check, chest x-ray, and blood work.
3. Consider hospital admission based on oxygen saturation and severity of symptoms.
4. Provide extra oxygen and hydration if admitted.
5. Administer antibiotics if pneumonia is confirmed.

Follow-up with the patient to monitor progress and adjust treatment as needed.
