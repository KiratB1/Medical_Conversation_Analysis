**List of symptoms:**
- Shortness of breath
- Coughing
- Chest pain
- Mucus production (creamy yellow sputum)
- Fatigue
- Night sweats
- Low-grade fever
- Stuffy nose
- Weight loss (denied)
- Hot sensation
- Mild stuffy nose
- Soreness due to persistent coughing

**List of possible diseases or illnesses:**
- Respiratory infection (pneumonia or viral)
- Acute bronchitis
- Asthma exacerbation
- Pulmonary embolism
- Congestive heart failure (less likely due to age and activity level)
- Sarcoidosis (less likely due to acute presentation)
- Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
- Pulmonary fibrosis
- Lung cancer (less likely given the acute onset)

**SOAP Note:**

**Subjective:**
The patient, Jessica, presents with a 2-day history of shortness of breath, coughing, chest pain exacerbated by coughing and deep breaths, and creamy yellow sputum production. She reports feeling fatigued, experiencing night sweats, and having a low-grade fever. Jessica denies weight loss but mentions feeling hot and having a mild stuffy nose. She also reports a sore throat due to persistent coughing.

**Objective:**
- Patient appears fatigued but alert and oriented.
- No signs of respiratory distress at rest.
- Normal heart rate and blood pressure.
- Clear lung sounds on auscultation.
- No swelling or palpitations noted.
- No abnormal findings on abdominal examination.
- No recent weight loss observed.

**Assessment:**
1. Acute respiratory infection (likely pneumonia or viral)
2. Differential diagnosis includes asthma exacerbation, COPD exacerbation, or pulmonary embolism.
3. Rule out CHF, sarcoidosis, pulmonary fibrosis, and lung cancer given the acute presentation and patient's age and activity level.

**Plan:**
1. Perform blood work to assess white blood cell count.
2. Chest X-ray to evaluate for pneumonia, consolidation, or other abnormalities.
3. Consider pulmonary function tests if indicated.
4. Follow up with the patient after investigations for further management and treatment.

Additional considerations:
- Monitor for any worsening symptoms or new developments.
- Educate the patient on symptom management and when to seek medical attention if symptoms worsen.
- Advise on rest, hydration, and proper medication adherence for diabetes and other prescribed medications.
