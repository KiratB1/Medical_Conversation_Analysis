**SOAP Note:**

**Subjective:**
A year-old male patient presents with a two-day history of fever, dry cough, runny nose, chills, sore throat, and muscle aches. The patient's parent reports a decrease in appetite but mentions the sore throat is not severe enough to affect eating habits significantly.

**Objective:**
- Vital signs: Fever of 38.8Â°C measured at home
- Physical examination reveals no wheezing, chest pain, shortness of breath, or other respiratory distress
- Clear runny nose, no colored discharge
- No eye symptoms, ear pain, dizziness, numbness, or tingling reported
- Patient has been gaining weight, no rashes, no changes in bowel movements or urine output
- Developmentally meeting milestones, up to date with immunizations, no allergies reported

**Assessment:**
- Likely viral infection or influenza based on symptoms presented
- Rule out COVID-19 with a swab test due to overlapping symptoms
- No focal neurological deficits reported

**Plan:**
1. Perform a COVID-19 swab test to confirm or rule out infection.
2. Provide supportive care including hydration, nutritious foods, and monitoring symptoms.
3. Advise the parent to watch for any worsening symptoms, especially focal neurological deficits, and seek immediate medical attention if needed.
4. Follow up in 24 to 48 hours for COVID-19 test results and reevaluation of symptoms.
