The patient presents with a one-month history of lower back pain, buttock pain, and radiating pain down the right leg. The pain is described as sharp and burning, with a tingling sensation in the right leg. Pain worsens with physical activity, and the patient rates it as 5-6 out of 10, reaching 8 out of 10 at times. The patient has a history of back injury six to seven years ago and currently experiences difficulty walking, limping, and putting more weight on the left leg.
