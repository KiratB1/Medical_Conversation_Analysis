The cough has worsened over the past week, leading to the need to sit down and catch breath with movement. The patient reports chills, stuffy nose, and a history of COPD for over 10 years. There is a past history of lung infection requiring hospitalization and current use of multiple puffers including Ventolin and Spiriva. The patient also reports smoking a pack a day for the last 20 years and occasional alcohol consumption.

**Assessment:**
1. Exacerbation of COPD with respiratory symptoms suggestive of a viral or bacterial infection.
2. Concern for COVID-19 given the overlap of symptoms; COVID swab ordered with isolation for 14 days.
3. Need for reassessment of current COPD management and potential addition of inhaled corticosteroids and antibiotics.
4. Consideration for chest X-ray and pulmonary function test to further evaluate respiratory status.

**Plan:**
1. COVID swab to be conducted with results expected in 24-48 hours.
2. Isolation for 14 days as per COVID-19 protocol.
3. Reevaluation of COPD management including puffer use and potential addition of inhaled corticosteroids and antibiotics.
4. Chest X-ray and pulmonary function test recommended for further assessment.
5. Follow-up appointment scheduled to review test results and adjust treatment plan as necessary.
