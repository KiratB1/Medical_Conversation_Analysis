**List of symptoms:**
- Pain in the right ear for the last 3-4 days
- Irritability
- Runny nose
- Cough (dry, started yesterday)
  
**List of possible diseases or illnesses:**
- Acute otitis media
- Upper respiratory infection
- Viral infection

**SOAP Note:**

**Subjective:**
A child presented with a chief complaint of right ear pain for the past 3-4 days associated with irritability. The patient's parent reported a recent history of a runny nose that resolved, followed by the onset of ear pain. The parent also mentioned a dry cough that started yesterday. No fever, hearing loss, swelling, redness, or fluid discharge from the ear reported.

**Objective:**
- No visible swelling, redness, or warmth in the right ear
- Clear runny nose, no yellow or green discharge
- Dry cough, no phlegm or blood
- No shortness of breath, wheezing, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, changes in bowel movements, or urinary changes reported

**Assessment:**
1. Acute otitis media: Given the unilateral ear pain, history of recent upper respiratory symptoms, and absence of systemic symptoms like fever, this could be a likely diagnosis.
2. Upper respiratory infection: The presence of a runny nose and dry cough suggests a possible viral upper respiratory infection.
3. Viral infection: Considering the constellation of symptoms without significant systemic involvement, a viral infection is also a differential diagnosis.

**Plan:**
1. Perform a thorough ear examination to assess for signs of acute otitis media.
2. If tympanic membrane is perforated or pus is present, prescribe a 10-day course of antibiotics (Amoxicillin or Cefuroxime).
3. If no systemic symptoms are present, reassess in 24-48 hours and consider antibiotic therapy if needed.
4. Advise monitoring for any worsening symptoms and follow up if necessary.
