**List of symptoms:**
- Numbness and tingling in feet
- Open wounds on feet
- Muscle weakness in legs
- Numbness and tingling in fingertips
- Clumsiness and difficulty gripping objects

**List of possible diseases or illnesses:**
- Peripheral neuropathy (likely due to diabetes)
- Vitamin deficiencies (less likely)
- Osteomyelitis (if there are underlying infections preventing wound healing)

**SOAP Note:**

**Subjective:**
The patient presents with a history of numbness and tingling in both feet for the past 2 years, worsening over the last 3 months. He also reports open wounds on his feet, muscle weakness in legs, numbness in fingertips, and difficulty gripping objects. The patient has a history of diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and obesity. He reports high A1C levels and daily alcohol consumption (5 beers/day) and smoking half a pack of cigarettes daily for the past 20 years.

**Objective:**
- No swelling, redness, or temperature changes in feet or joints
- Scarring from healed ulcers on feet
- No pain on palpation over ankle joint or toes
- Normal range of motion in feet and toes
- Normal gait without limping

**Assessment:**
1. Peripheral neuropathy likely due to diabetes, presenting as numbness and tingling in feet and fingertips, with associated wounds and muscle weakness.
2. Differential diagnosis includes vitamin deficiencies and potential osteomyelitis if there are underlying infections preventing wound healing.

**Plan:**
1. Focus on improving diabetes control to prevent further nerve damage.
2. Monitor feet regularly for any open wounds or sores and seek medical attention if there are signs of infection.
3. Emphasize the importance of foot hygiene and regular self-examinations.
4. Encourage the patient to cut down on alcohol consumption and consider smoking cessation to improve overall health and diabetes management.
5. Follow up with the patient to assess progress and address any concerns or complications.
