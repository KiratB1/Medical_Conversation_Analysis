The patient's girlfriend recently returned from a work trip and has been fatigued since, raising concerns about potential exposure. The patient denies any medication use for symptom relief.

**Assessment:**
1. Differential diagnosis includes common cold, viral respiratory infection, influenza, and COVID-19 given the patient's symptoms of fever, dry cough, fatigue, runny nose, and altered sense of smell.
2. Possible exposure to illness through contact with fatigued girlfriend who recently traveled.
3. Rule out COVID-19 due to the current pandemic situation and high fever reported by the patient.

**Plan:**
1. Conduct a COVID-19 swab test to rule out infection.
2. Monitor the patient's temperature and further assess symptoms.
3. Consider supportive care measures for symptom relief if necessary.
4. Follow up with the patient after consulting with the attending physician for further management based on test results and clinical evaluation.
