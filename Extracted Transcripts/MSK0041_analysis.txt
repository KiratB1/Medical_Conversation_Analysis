**SOAP Note:**

**Subjective:**
The patient presents with intense sharp pain in the right foot below the big toe that started six hours ago and has remained constant. The pain is worsened by movement and upon touching with shoes. There is redness, swelling, and warmth in the affected area. The patient reports inability to bend, flex, or extend the affected toe and has a limited range of motion. The pain is described as an 8 on a scale of 1 to 10, with no previous history of similar pain in the toes or other joints.

**Objective:**
- Redness and swelling observed in the right foot, with warmth noted compared to the left foot
- Limited range of motion in the affected toe
- No pain at the ankle or other toes
- No muscle atrophy or joint malalignment observed
- Limping gait to avoid putting weight on the right big toe

**Assessment:**
Based on the patient's symptoms and examination findings, the most likely diagnosis is gout, specifically a gout flare known as podagra. Septic arthritis needs to be ruled out due to the risk factors such as diabetes and obesity. A joint fluid aspiration is recommended to confirm the diagnosis and ensure appropriate treatment.

**Plan:**
1. Perform a joint fluid aspiration to confirm the diagnosis and rule out septic arthritis.
2. Initiate treatment with colchicine to help with the gout flare.
3. Start high doses of anti-inflammatories as necessary for pain management.
4. Educate the patient on lifestyle modifications to prevent future gout flares, including reducing intake of red meats and alcohol, weight loss, and improving diabetes management.
5. Follow up with the patient to monitor response to treatment and adjust management as needed.
