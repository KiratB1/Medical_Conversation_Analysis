**SOAP Note:**

**Subjective:**
A 5-year-old female patient presented with a cough that started two days ago, along with congestion, stuffy nose, and pink eye. The cough is described as harsh-sounding, and the patient's parent noted itchiness in the eyes and a possible sore throat. The patient has also experienced a decreased appetite and feeling hot.

**Objective:**
- No sputum production or blood in cough
- No wheezing, blood discharge, or changes in vision reported
- No tearing or mucus from the eyes
- No reported changes in smell, taste, or weight
- No night sweats, stomach pains, nausea, vomiting, painful urination, diarrhea, headaches, aches/pains, or rashes noted
- No previous medical conditions, surgeries, or allergies to medications reported
- Living situation includes the patient's primary caregiver and father, with no pets or smokers in the household
- No known exposure to lung or heart conditions in the family

**Assessment:**
Based on the patient's symptoms and history, the likely diagnosis includes a viral infection or common cold, possibly complicated by conjunctivitis (pink eye). Further investigation is warranted to rule out other possible causes.

**Plan:**
1. Conduct a swab test for COVID-19 to rule out viral infection.
2. Recommend symptomatic treatment for cough and congestion.
3. Provide guidance on managing pink eye symptoms.
4. Advise monitoring the patient's temperature and overall condition.
5. Schedule a follow-up appointment to assess the patient's progress and consider additional testing if necessary.
