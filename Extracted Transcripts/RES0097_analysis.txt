**Subjective:**
An 11-year-old male patient, Thomas, presented with a cough for the past three to four days, accompanied by a stuffy nose, watery nasal discharge, worsening cough at night, nasal congestion leading to mouth breathing, nasal voice, loss of smell, fever (39°C), chills, sore throat worse in the morning, muscle aches, fatigue, and weight gain. The patient has a history of cystic fibrosis with previous hospitalizations every two years. The mother expressed concern about the high fever and similarity of symptoms to previous exacerbations.

**Objective:**
- Vital signs: Fever of 39°C, chills reported
- Physical examination findings: Pending

**Assessment:**
1. Possible exacerbation of cystic fibrosis given the patient's history and symptoms.
2. Differential diagnosis includes upper respiratory tract infection, sinusitis, bacterial pneumonia, or viral infection.

**Plan:**
1. Conduct a thorough physical examination to assess respiratory status, including lung auscultation and oxygen saturation.
2. Consider starting antibiotics empirically due to the high fever and symptoms suggestive of a bacterial infection.
3. Monitor closely for any signs of respiratory distress or worsening symptoms.
4. Follow up with the respirologist for further management and coordination of care for the patient's cystic fibrosis.
5. Educate the patient and family on symptom management, including hydration and rest.
6. Advise the patient to continue current medications and treatments for cystic fibrosis as prescribed.
7. Schedule a follow-up appointment to reassess the patient's condition and adjust the treatment plan as needed.
