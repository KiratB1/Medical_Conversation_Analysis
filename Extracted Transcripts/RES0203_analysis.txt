**List of symptoms:**

**SOAP Note:**

**Subjective:**
The patient presents with a two-day history of loss of sense of smell and taste, along with a mild dry cough. Patient expresses concerns about the possibility of having COVID-19.

**Objective:**
- Patient reports that smell is not completely gone, can still smell strong odors, and can taste salty foods but not normal flavors like banana.
- Dry cough has been consistent over the last couple of days.
- Denies fevers, difficulty breathing, headaches, sore throat, chills, night sweats, muscle aches, general weakness, chest pain, chronic conditions, allergies, and family history of respiratory problems, cancers, or heart problems.
- Patient is a high school student in their last year, living with parents and younger sibling, with no recent travel history except for hiking locally.

**Assessment:**
1. Differential diagnosis includes:
   - COVID-19: Loss of taste and smell, dry cough are common symptoms.
   - Upper respiratory tract infection: Presents with similar symptoms.
   - Common cold: Could explain the mild dry cough.

**Plan:**
1. Conduct a COVID-19 test with a swab to confirm or rule out infection.
2. Advise self-isolation until test results are back and potentially longer if symptoms persist.
3. Consider additional tests based on the results and further evaluation by the doctor.
4. Follow up with patient for test results and further management.
