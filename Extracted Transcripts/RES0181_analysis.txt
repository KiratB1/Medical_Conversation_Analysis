**List of symptoms:**
- Sore throat for the past three days
- Fever
- Painful to swallow solids
- Fatigue

**List of possible diseases or illnesses:**
- Strep throat or Group A strep pharyngitis
- Viral illness
- COVID-19

**SOAP Note:**

**Subjective:**
The patient presents with a sore throat persisting for the past three days, accompanied by a fever. The sore throat is painful when swallowing solids, and the patient reports feeling fatigued.

**Objective:**
- No voice changes noted
- No neck swelling
- Appetite decreased due to throat pain
- Fever recorded at 38.8Â°C
- No cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, wheezing, or palpitations reported
- No gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, or constipation
- No urinary issues, skin changes, muscle aches, or body pains observed

**Assessment:**
The patient likely presents with strep throat or Group A strep pharyngitis, given the symptoms of sore throat, fever, and swollen tonsils. Viral illness is also a possibility, but bacterial infection is higher on the differential. COVID-19 needs to be ruled out due to the ongoing pandemic.

**Plan:**
1. Perform a rapid strep antigen test to confirm the presence of strep throat.
2. Consider testing for COVID-19 to rule out infection.
3. Provide symptomatic relief for pain and fever.
4. Advise rest and hydration.
5. Follow up with the patient after test results to determine appropriate treatment.
