**List of symptoms:**
- Right knee pain
- Swelling in the right knee
- Warmth in the right knee
- Pain located slightly below the patella
- Pain started two weeks ago
- Constant achy pain, sometimes sharp
- Pain worsens with kneeling, touching, and flexing the knee
- Pain improves when the knee is kept straight and not touched
- Pain severity rated at 6 out of 10

**List of possible diseases or illnesses:**
- Knee bursitis (likely prepatellar or infra patellar)
- Septic bursitis (less likely due to absence of fevers or chills)
- Meniscal injury
- Ligamental injury

**SOAP Note:**

**Subjective:**
The patient presents with complaints of right knee pain that started two weeks ago. The pain is described as constant, mostly achy but can be sharp, and localized slightly below the patella. The patient attributes the pain to increased pressure on the right knee due to osteoarthritis in the left knee. Pain worsens with kneeling, touching, and flexing the knee, while it improves when the knee is kept straight and untouched. The pain is rated at 6 out of 10 in severity.

**Objective:**
- Swelling, redness, and warmth noted in the right knee, particularly below the kneecap area.
- Tenderness and pain upon palpation of the swollen area.
- Full range of motion in the knee, but bending causes significant pain.
- No noticeable limp, patient able to walk normally.

**Assessment:**
- Likely diagnosis of knee bursitis, specifically prepatellar or infra patellar bursitis, secondary to repetitive kneeling and increased pressure on the right knee.
- Septic bursitis considered but less likely due to absence of systemic symptoms.
- Differential diagnoses include a meniscal injury or ligamental injury.

**Plan:**
1. Activity modification to avoid exacerbating the symptoms.
2. NSAIDs for pain management and inflammation reduction.
3. Ice application to the affected area to help with swelling.
4. Monitor for worsening symptoms, such as fever or increased pain, which may indicate the need for further evaluation to rule out infection or structural damage.
5. Follow-up appointment scheduled to assess treatment response and consider additional interventions if necessary.
