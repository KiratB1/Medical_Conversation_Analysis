**Assessment:**
1. Viral illness: Considering the patient's symptoms of loss of taste, dry cough, fatigue, diarrhea, and exposure to a sick classmate, viral upper respiratory infection or COVID-19 are likely differential diagnoses.
2. Gastrointestinal infection: Diarrhea could also suggest a gastrointestinal infection.

**Plan:**
1. COVID-19 testing: Perform a COVID-19 swab to rule out infection.
2. Isolation: Instruct the patient to isolate for 14 days regardless of test results.
3. Symptomatic management: Provide supportive care for symptoms such as cough, fatigue, and diarrhea.
4. Follow-up: Arrange for a follow-up visit to review test results and monitor the patient's progress.
