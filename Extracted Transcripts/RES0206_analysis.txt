**List of symptoms:**
- Increased coughing
- Increased sputum production (green-yellow sputum)
- Coughing up blood
- Difficulty breathing
- Worsening shortness of breath
- Fever
- Sinus pressure
- Headache

**List of possible diseases or illnesses:**
- COPD exacerbation
- Respiratory infection
- Pneumonia
- Possible COVID-19 infection

**SOAP Note:**

**Subjective:**
The patient presents with a history of COPD diagnosed 4-5 years ago, experiencing worsening symptoms over the past 3 days. Symptoms include increased coughing with green-yellow sputum production, coughing up blood, difficulty breathing, worsening shortness of breath, fever, sinus pressure, and headache. The patient also reports potential exposure to a sick friend and recent lifestyle changes to manage COPD.

**Objective:**
- Vital signs: Pending
- Physical examination findings: Pending
- COVID-19 swab test pending
- Patient appears fatigued but alert and oriented

**Assessment:**
1. COPD exacerbation: Likely exacerbation of COPD due to recent worsening of symptoms and history of COPD.
2. Respiratory infection/pneumonia: Considering the presence of fever, increased sputum production, and coughing up blood.
3. Possible COVID-19 infection: Given the patient's exposure to a sick friend and fever, COVID-19 needs to be ruled out.

**Plan:**
1. Conduct a thorough physical examination and assess vital signs.
2. Perform a COVID-19 swab test to rule out infection.
3. Consider chest X-ray to evaluate for pneumonia.
4. Monitor oxygen saturation and respiratory status closely.
5. Consult with attending physician to determine the need for hospital admission based on lab results and vital signs.
6. Provide supportive care, including oxygen therapy and bronchodilators as needed.
7. Educate the patient on the importance of medication adherence and follow-up care for COPD management.
8. Follow up with the patient after test results are available to discuss further management options.
