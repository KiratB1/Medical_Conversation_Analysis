**SOAP Note:**

**Subjective:**
The patient presents with symptoms of a runny nose, congestion, pressure around the nose and jaw, pain in cheeks and front of teeth, clear nasal discharge, alternating nostril obstruction, loss of smell, red and itchy eyes, and brief episodes of chills. Symptoms have been ongoing for five days with a history of a runny nose eight days prior. The patient denies cough, sore throat, wheezing, shortness of breath, chest pain, lightheadedness, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, urinary problems, rashes, muscle or joint aches, muscle weakness, recent weight loss, and fevers. The patient reports difficulty sleeping due to congestion but denies significant fatigue.

**Objective:**
- Vital signs: Not mentioned
- Physical examination: Not conducted (based on the conversation)

**Assessment:**
Based on the patient's symptoms, history, and examination, the likely diagnosis is acute sinusitis. The symptoms of clear nasal discharge, obstruction, loss of smell, facial pain, red and itchy eyes, and brief chills are consistent with this diagnosis. The patient's history of a similar episode two years ago suggests a recurrent sinus issue.

**Plan:**
1. Advise the patient to monitor their temperature for fever.
2. If a fever is present, consider prescribing antibiotics for suspected bacterial sinusitis.
3. Recommend supportive care measures such as nasal saline irrigation, steam inhalation, and over-the-counter decongestants or antihistamines for symptom relief.
4. Follow up with the patient to assess symptom progression and the need for further intervention.

The patient will be monitored closely for any worsening of symptoms or the development of new concerns.
