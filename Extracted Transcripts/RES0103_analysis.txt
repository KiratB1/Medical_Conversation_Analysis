**SOAP Note:**

**Subjective:**
The patient is a young girl brought in by her parent with complaints of a runny nose, sneezing, nasal congestion, and a dry cough that started about three to four days ago. The symptoms have been constant and have worsened over time. The patient also feels warm to touch, looks flushed, fatigued, and irritable. There is no history of recent travel, exposure to allergens, or significant past medical conditions.

**Objective:**
- Vital signs: Not mentioned
- Physical examination planned to assess for signs of systemic infection
- No reported significant findings on initial assessment

**Assessment:**
Based on the patient's symptoms and history, it is likely she is suffering from a viral upper respiratory infection such as a common cold. Allergic rhinitis or sinusitis are also possible differential diagnoses. There are no signs of a bacterial infection warranting antibiotics at this time.

**Plan:**
1. Monitor symptoms at home for any worsening, including shortness of breath, increased cough with yellow or green material, or persistent fever.
2. Perform a physical examination to further evaluate the patient's condition.
3. Provide supportive care with rest, hydration, and over-the-counter cold medications as needed.
4. Advise the parent to follow up if there are any concerning developments or if symptoms persist or worsen.
5. Educate the parent on signs that may indicate the need for further medical attention.

Follow-up appointment or contact may be necessary depending on the patient's response to supportive care.
