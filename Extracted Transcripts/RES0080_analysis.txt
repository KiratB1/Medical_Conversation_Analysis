**List of symptoms:**

**List of possible diseases or illnesses:**
- Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) exacerbation
- Respiratory infection
- Bronchitis

**SOAP Note:**

**Subjective:**
The patient presents with worsening shortness of breath and increased sputum production over the past three to four days. The sputum is described as yellow/green in color, markedly different from the usual whiteish and foamy sputum. The patient reports a chronic cough for the past 20 years, with no recent worsening. There is a history of COPD, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol. The patient is a long-term smoker of 45 years, consuming a pack of cigarettes per day. No recent travel or exposure to sick individuals reported.

**Objective:**
- Vital signs: Pending, including temperature check
- Chest X-ray, blood gases, and sputum culture ordered
- Plan to start antibiotics based on severity
- Plan to initiate inhalers and inhaled steroid for airway inflammation

**Assessment:**
1. COPD exacerbation with respiratory infection likely contributing to worsening symptoms
2. Chronic smoking history exacerbating respiratory condition
3. Possible bronchitis or pneumonia given the change in sputum color and increased shortness of breath

**Plan:**
1. Monitor vital signs, including temperature
2. Obtain chest X-ray, blood gases, and sputum culture
3. Consider starting antibiotics based on severity of symptoms
4. Initiate inhalers and inhaled steroid for airway inflammation
5. Encourage smoking cessation and provide resources for support

Follow-up appointment scheduled to review diagnostic results and adjust treatment plan accordingly.
