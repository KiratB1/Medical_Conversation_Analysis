**SOAP Note:**

**Subjective:**
The patient, Jean, presents with a recent tick bite behind the left knee. She reports redness and tenderness in the area where the tick was removed. Jean mentions a history of a previous tick bite with a target rash but denies current presence of a bullseye rash. She has not experienced joint pain, fever, or other symptoms since the tick bite.

**Objective:**
- Physical examination reveals redness and tenderness behind the left knee.
- The tick removed by the patient appears small and not engorged.
- No signs of systemic illness or fever are noted.
- No other tick bites are found on the body upon examination.

**Assessment:**
1. Tick bite with localized redness and tenderness, possibly indicating a mild inflammatory reaction.
2. Concern for tick-borne illnesses such as Lyme disease due to the patient's history of a previous tick bite with a target rash.
3. Consideration for prophylactic antibiotics due to the potential duration of tick attachment exceeding 72 hours.

**Plan:**
1. Send the tick for species identification at a local laboratory.
2. Consider starting the patient on prophylactic antibiotics to prevent Lyme disease.
3. Discuss the case with the physician for further evaluation and management.
4. Monitor for any signs of Lyme disease or worsening symptoms.
5. Educate the patient on tick prevention strategies, such as checking for ticks after outdoor activities and using insecticides in tick-prone areas.
6. Follow up with the patient for review of laboratory results and assessment of symptoms.
