**List of symptoms:**
- Shortness of breath on exertion
- Nasty cough with yellow/brown phlegm
- Wheeziness
- Chest pain (not at rest, across chest)
- Sore throat
- Headaches (associated with stress)
- Decreased sense of smell and taste
- Knee pain
- High blood pressure
- High cholesterol
- Smoking history (half pack/day for 2 years, previous pack/day or more)
- Alcohol consumption (20 beers on weekends)
- Sedentary lifestyle due to COVID-19 restrictions

**List of possible diseases or illnesses:**
- Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) due to smoking history
- Cardiovascular issues (heart disease, heart attack) based on family history
- Respiratory infection or bronchitis
- Stress-related headaches

**SOAP Note:**
**Subjective:**
The patient presents with concerns of increasing shortness of breath on exertion over the last couple of months, accompanied by a cough producing yellow/brown phlegm, wheeziness, and chest pain across the chest. He reports a history of decreased sense of smell and taste for the past 10 years, headaches associated with stress, knee pain, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol. The patient has a significant smoking history of a pack/day previously, currently half pack/day for 2 years, and alcohol consumption of 20 beers on weekends. He notes a sedentary lifestyle due to COVID-19 restrictions.

**Objective:**
- Vital signs: Blood pressure within normal range, heart rate within normal limits
- Physical examination: Chest auscultation reveals wheezing, no signs of respiratory distress, no edema in extremities, no cyanosis
- Chest X-ray ordered for further evaluation

**Assessment:**
1. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) likely due to smoking history
2. Rule out cardiovascular issues based on family history and presenting symptoms
3. Respiratory infection or bronchitis as a differential diagnosis

**Plan:**
1. Order pulmonary function test and chest X-ray to assess lung function and rule out other lung conditions.
2. Initiate treatment with short or long-acting beta-agonist inhaler for possible COPD.
3. Monitor blood pressure and cholesterol levels, consider adjustments to medications if needed.
4. Advise smoking cessation and reduction of alcohol consumption for overall health improvement.
5. Encourage regular physical activity within COVID-19 safety guidelines to improve lung function.
6. Follow-up appointment scheduled for further evaluation and management.
