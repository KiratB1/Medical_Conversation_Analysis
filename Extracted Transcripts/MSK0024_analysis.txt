**SOAP Note:**

**Subjective:**
The patient presents with lower back pain that has been persistent for the past month. The pain is described as dull and achy with occasional spasms, exacerbated by bending down, and more pronounced on the right side. The patient works in a factory involving heavy lifting, which may have triggered the pain. Temporary relief is experienced with topical analgesics. No other concerning symptoms reported.

**Objective:**
- No visible signs of redness or swelling in the back.
- Pain reported upon palpation in the middle of the lower back, just above the buttocks area.
- Pain experienced when raising legs straight up without bending the knees, localized to the lower back.
- Gait remains unaffected, and the patient can walk without a limp.

**Assessment:**
- Likely diagnosis of mechanical back pain, possibly related to disc compression due to repetitive heavy lifting at work.
- Rule out other musculoskeletal conditions given the patient's history and presentation.

**Plan:**
1. Prescribe pain management and anti-inflammatory medication for symptom relief.
2. Recommend physiotherapy and exercises to strengthen the back muscles and improve flexibility.
3. Advise on ergonomic practices at work to prevent further strain.
4. Follow up in six weeks to assess response to conservative management before considering imaging studies.
5. Monitor for any red flags or worsening symptoms that may require immediate evaluation.
