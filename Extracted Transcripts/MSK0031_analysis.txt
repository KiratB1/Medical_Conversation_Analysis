**SOAP Note:**

**Subjective:**
The patient, a middle-aged female, presents with a history of falling down the stairs two hours ago, resulting in excruciating pain in her right hip. The pain is described as sharp, radiating to the right groin, and associated with swelling. The patient reports difficulty bearing weight on the right hip, dizziness post-fall, and warmth in the affected area. She denies numbness, tingling, headaches, joint pains elsewhere, recent weight loss, fevers, chills, rashes, changes in vision, hearing, smell, taste, cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, heart palpitations, changes in bowel movements, changes in urine, and recent travel.

**Objective:**
Physical examination reveals swelling and redness in the right hip area, with some bruising noted. The right hip appears to be warmer than the left and demonstrates outward turning. The patient experiences significant pain upon attempting to stand up from a sitting position and has limited range of motion in the right hip.

**Assessment:**
1. Hip fracture likely due to the fall down the stairs, leading to severe pain, swelling, and limited mobility.
2. Possible exacerbation of osteoarthritis in the right hip.
3. Soft tissue injury and muscle strain in the right hip region.
4. Risk of nerve compression or hematoma formation in the affected area.

**Plan:**
1. Refer the patient to an orthopedic surgeon for further evaluation and consideration of surgical options such as internal repair with screws, total hip replacement, or partial hip replacement.
2. Initiate pain management with ibuprofen or over-the-counter pain medications.
3. Recommend physiotherapy for post-surgical rehabilitation to improve range of motion and strengthen hip muscles.
4. Monitor for any signs of infection or complications post-surgery.
5. Follow-up with the patient to assess recovery progress and adjust treatment plan as needed.
