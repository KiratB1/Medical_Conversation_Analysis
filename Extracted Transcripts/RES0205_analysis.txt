**SOAP Note:**

**Subjective:**
The patient has been experiencing a persistent cough for the past two weeks, initially accompanied by mucus production which has now transitioned into a dry cough. They also reported sore throat, runny nose, and flu-like symptoms at the onset. The cough is not improving and is causing chest pain with excessive coughing. The patient denies difficulty breathing, fevers, nausea, vomiting, or belly pain.

**Objective:**
- Patient denies difficulty breathing, fevers, nausea, vomiting, or belly pain.
- Physical examination revealed no abnormal findings upon initial assessment.

**Assessment:**
1. Differential Diagnosis:
   - Acute bronchitis: Given the persistent cough, initial mucus production, and chest pain with coughing.
   - Viral upper respiratory infection: Consistent with the patient's symptoms of runny nose and flu-like symptoms at the beginning.
   - Allergic cough: Considering the patient's history of hay fever and potential triggers.
   - Gastroesophageal reflux disease exacerbation leading to cough: Patient's history of acid reflux and symptoms worsening with certain foods.

**Plan:**
1. Further evaluation: Recommend chest X-ray to rule out pneumonia or other underlying lung conditions.
2. Symptomatic treatment: Prescribe cough suppressants or expectorants as needed for symptom relief.
3. Lifestyle modifications: Advise the patient to avoid triggers, such as acidic foods, that may exacerbate their cough.
4. Follow-up: Schedule a follow-up appointment to monitor the progress of symptoms and adjust treatment if necessary.
