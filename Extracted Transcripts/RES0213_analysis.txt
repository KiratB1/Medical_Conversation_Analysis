**SOAP Note:**

**Subjective:**
The patient, a 26-year-old graduate student, presents with complaints of chest pain that started about a week and a half ago. The pain is described as sharp and strong, exacerbated by deep breaths, and lasts for approximately 20 minutes. The patient notes that the pain is more noticeable when sitting, studying, or walking to school and tends to occur intermittently throughout the day. The patient expressed concerns about the possibility of heart-related issues due to a family history of heart problems and recent stress related to academic responsibilities and smoking cessation.

**Objective:**
- No reported fevers or recent illnesses
- Smoking history: Previously smoked 10 cigarettes a day for the last two years, currently trying to quit and has reduced smoking to about 5 cigarettes a day
- No significant findings on physical examination mentioned in the transcript

**Assessment:**
1. **Chest pain:** Likely multifactorial, including stress-induced, musculoskeletal, and potentially cardiac etiologies given the family history of heart problems.
2. **Anxiety:** Patient reports increased stress related to academic workload and smoking cessation, which may contribute to the chest pain symptoms.

**Plan:**
1. **Further Evaluation:** Consideration for further cardiac evaluation, such as an ECG or cardiac enzymes, to rule out any underlying cardiac issues.
2. **Pain Management:** Recommend continued monitoring of symptoms and avoiding triggers. Non-pharmacological interventions for stress management may be beneficial, such as relaxation techniques, mindfulness, and regular exercise.
3. **Follow-up:** Schedule a follow-up appointment to review any diagnostic tests and reassess symptoms. Encourage the patient to maintain open communication regarding any changes or concerns.
