A 1-year-old male infant presents with a one-day history of grunting noises, high fever (38.7°C), irritability, coughing, spit ups, decreased feeding, and normal wet diapers. No vomiting, rashes, or changes in bowel movements noted. The patient was born premature at 36 weeks.

   - Pneumonia
   - COVID-19

2. Plan:
   - Obtain temperature, O2 saturation, and imaging to differentiate between bronchiolitis and pneumonia.
   - Supportive treatment for bronchiolitis, including hospitalization for hydration and oxygen therapy if needed.
   - Antibiotics if diagnosed with pneumonia.
   - COVID-19 swab to rule out infection.
   - Hospitalization recommended for distress, oxygen requirement, and IV hydration.

Follow-up: Await diagnostic results and adjust treatment plan accordingly.
