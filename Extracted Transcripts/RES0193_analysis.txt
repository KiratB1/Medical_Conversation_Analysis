**List of possible diseases or illnesses:**

**SOAP Note:**

**Subjective:**
A 6-year-old male patient presents with a history of cough, wheezing, and difficulty breathing, especially at night and after physical exertion. The cough is dry, and the patient experiences wheezing with a high-pitched whistling sound upon exhalation. The symptoms have been occurring multiple times per week for several months. The patient's mother reports a history of bronchiolitis in early childhood and environmental allergies manifesting as itchy eyes and a runny nose during seasonal changes. The patient has missed school days due to poor sleep and feeling unwell.

**Objective:**
- No fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, or changes in bowel movements reported
- No recent travel or exposure to sick individuals
- No significant changes in appetite, weight gain noted
- Environmental exposure to a cat at a friend's house
- Family history of asthma in the patient's mother
- No smoking in the household, but presence of a carpet in the basement

**Assessment:**
1. Differential Diagnosis:
   - Asthma
   - Allergic reactions
   - Environmental allergies
   
2. Working Diagnosis:
   - Asthma exacerbation triggered by physical activity and environmental allergens

**Plan:**
1. Perform a full physical examination, focusing on respiratory function and auscultation.
2. Consider ordering a pulmonary function test to assess lung function and potential asthma diagnosis.
3. Discuss the possibility of allergy testing to identify triggers.
4. Consider initiating treatment with a bronchodilator (e.g., Ventolin) and an inhaled corticosteroid for symptom management.
5. Educate the patient and family on asthma management, including trigger avoidance and proper medication use.
6. Follow up with the patient to monitor response to treatment and adjust management as needed.

The patient and his mother will be scheduled for further evaluation and testing to confirm the diagnosis and establish an appropriate treatment plan.
