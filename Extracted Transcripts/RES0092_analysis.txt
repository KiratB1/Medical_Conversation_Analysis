They also experienced a runny nose, sore throat, headache, aches, and fatigue which lasted for about three days but have since resolved. No fevers, chills, blood in sputum, chest pain, palpitations, gastrointestinal symptoms, or urinary symptoms reported.

- Differential diagnosis includes a common cold.

**Plan:**
1. Monitor symptoms and encourage rest and hydration.
2. Recommend over-the-counter cough suppressants or expectorants as needed.
3. Follow up in one week to assess symptom progression.
4. Educate patient on when to seek medical attention if symptoms worsen or new symptoms develop, such as fever or chest pain.
