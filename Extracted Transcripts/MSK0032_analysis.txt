**SOAP note:**

**Subjective:**
The patient is a young girl brought in by her parent due to pain in her right elbow, which started after a play incident at the park. The pain is described as aching and constant, radiating from the elbow to the upper arm. The patient is experiencing discomfort and has been crying due to the pain, rated at a 7 out of 10. There is no history of similar pain in the past.

**Objective:**
- Physical examination did not reveal any redness, swelling, muscle atrophy, deformities, or skin changes in the right elbow.
- Palpation of the elbow caused pain, while the forearm muscles, biceps, and triceps did not elicit significant pain.
- No other abnormalities noted during the physical examination.

**Assessment:**
Likely diagnosis of radial head subluxation (nursemaid's elbow) based on history of a jerk movement during play and subsequent pain in the elbow radiating to the upper arm.

**Plan:**
1. Conservative management with ice packs and over-the-counter painkillers.
2. Reduction of the radial head back into its normal position, which may require a few minutes.
3. Consider splinting if pain persists.
4. No immediate need for imaging.
5. Follow-up to monitor the patient's progress and ensure normal function of the arm is restored.
