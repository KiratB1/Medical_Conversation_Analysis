**List of symptoms:**
- Shoulder pain for the past week
- Pain with any movement of the right shoulder
- Sharp pain with movement
- Stiffness and achy feeling at rest
- Pain located at the joint between upper arm and shoulder
- Pain rated 7 out of 10

**List of possible diseases or illnesses:**
- Rotator cuff injury
- Adhesive capsulitis (frozen shoulder)

**SOAP Note:**

**Subjective:**
The patient presents with a chief complaint of severe shoulder pain for the past week, exacerbated by any movement. Patient reports a history of a rotator cuff injury a couple of months ago due to repetitive motions in the construction field. Pain is described as sharp with movement and achy at rest, rated at 7 out of 10. No significant radiation of pain to other joints or parts of the body reported. Temporary relief with ibuprofen and ice application noted.

**Objective:**
- No visible swelling, redness, or deformities noted on examination.
- Tenderness on palpation with firm pressure but no tenderness otherwise.
- No significant limitations in passive range of motion.
- No systemic symptoms such as fever, chills, weight loss, or appetite changes reported.
- Patient denies numbness, tingling, weakness, or other musculoskeletal symptoms.

**Assessment:**
- Likely diagnosis of adhesive capsulitis (frozen shoulder) based on patient history of previous rotator cuff injury and current symptoms of pain, stiffness, and limited range of motion.
- Rule out other differential diagnoses such as rotator cuff tear or bursitis through imaging studies (X-Ray, ultrasound) and blood work to assess inflammation markers.

**Plan:**
1. Order X-Ray of the shoulder for comparison with previous imaging.
2. Consider ultrasound if necessary for further evaluation.
3. Perform blood work to assess inflammation markers.
4. Emphasize the importance of completing a full course of physiotherapy for conservative management.
5. Discuss potential corticosteroid injections for pain relief if conservative measures are ineffective.
6. Follow up with the patient for imaging results and further management strategies.
