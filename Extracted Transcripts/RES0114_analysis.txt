**SOAP Note:**

**Subjective:**
The patient presents with a chronic cough for the past five years, which has worsened over the last month. The cough is productive, with white material that recently showed a yellowish tinge. The patient reports wheezing with physical activities, swelling in the ankles, fatigue, and chest tightness during coughing fits. There is a history of COPD and high blood pressure. The patient mentions using a Ventolin inhaler for relief, which has become less effective recently.

**Objective:**

**Assessment:**
1. COPD exacerbation with possible respiratory infection due to the worsening cough and yellowish sputum.
2. Possible heart failure (congestive heart failure) based on the swelling in ankles and history of high blood pressure.
3. Allergic bronchitis or chronic bronchitis may also be considered given the chronic cough and wheezing.

**Plan:**
1. Conduct a COVID-19 swab test due to overlapping symptoms and advise self-isolation until results are available.
2. Continue current inhaler therapy and consider adding a long-acting beta-agonist and inhaled corticosteroids.
3. Monitor oxygen saturation and provide oxygen if necessary to maintain levels above 88%.
4. Consider prescribing azithromycin as an alternative to amoxicillin for possible infection.
5. Order a chest X-ray and pulmonary function test for further evaluation.
6. Educate the patient on COPD management, smoking cessation, and lifestyle modifications.
7. Follow up in 24-48 hours for test results and adjust treatment plan accordingly.
