**Plan:**
1. Recommend rest, hydration, and over-the-counter pain relievers for symptom relief.
2. Consider prescribing antihistamines for allergic rhinitis symptoms.

4. Educate on infection prevention measures, especially in the current COVID-19 situation.
5. Follow up with the patient in a few days to assess symptom progression.
