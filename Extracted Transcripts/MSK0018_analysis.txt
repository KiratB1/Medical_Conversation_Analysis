**SOAP Note:**

**Subjective:**
- The patient presented with intense pain in the right shoulder following a rugby incident where they were tackled and fell onto the shoulder.
- The pain is constant, sharp, and rated at 8-9 out of 10.
- The patient reports inability to move the right shoulder, with some numbness and deformities noted.
- No previous history of similar symptoms mentioned.

**Objective:**

- Deformity noted in the right shoulder with the shoulder appearing lower than the left.
- Limited range of motion in the right shoulder, unable to lift the shoulder up.
- No redness, swelling, or warmth observed in the shoulder area.

**Assessment:**
- Suspected right shoulder dislocation following trauma during rugby.
- Possible associated ligament injury or muscle strain.

**Plan:**
1. Order an x-ray of the shoulder joint to confirm the dislocation and rule out fractures.
2. Consider closed reduction to reposition the joint if feasible.
3. If closed reduction is unsuccessful, discuss the possibility of surgical intervention for ligament weakness or recurrent dislocations.
4. Immobilize the shoulder for a period of time based on severity, followed by rehabilitation to restore range of motion.
5. Monitor for any complications or worsening of symptoms during treatment.

Follow-up appointment scheduled to assess response to treatment and adjust management as needed.
