**SOAP Note:**

**Subjective:**
The patient presents with a history of twisting their right ankle while running the previous night. The pain started a few hours after the injury and has been constant since then. The pain is described as dull and achy, primarily located on the outside of the right ankle, radiating to the sole of the foot. The patient reports no swelling, redness, or skin changes. There is no history of fevers, chills, numbness, or tingling. The pain worsens with movement and improves with rest. The patient denies any weakness in extremities.

**Objective:**
- No visible swelling, redness, or skin changes on the right ankle.
- Mild tenderness on palpation on the outside of the right ankle.
- Limited range of motion due to pain, but the patient is able to move the ankle.
- Weight-bearing on the right ankle causes pain.
- No signs of deformity or instability noted.

**Assessment:**
Likely diagnosis of a right ankle sprain based on the mechanism of injury, symptoms reported, and physical examination findings. No evidence of fracture based on initial assessment. Differential diagnosis includes soft tissue injury or ligament injury due to the twisting mechanism reported by the patient.

**Plan:**
1. Immobilize the right ankle.
2. Recommend applying ice to reduce pain and swelling.
3. Advise the patient to take NSAIDs like Advil for pain relief.
4. Follow up for a physical examination to assess the need for an X-ray if significant pain on palpation or bony tenderness is present.
5. Consider physiotherapy for rehabilitation once the acute phase resolves.
6. Educate the patient on the importance of rest and avoiding aggravating activities.
7. Schedule a follow-up appointment for further evaluation and management.
