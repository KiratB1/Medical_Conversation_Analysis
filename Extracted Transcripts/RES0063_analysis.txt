**Subjective:**
The patient presents with a recent onset of feeling down, sore throat for the past 5 days, chills starting 3 days ago, muscle aches all over the body for the past 3 days, difficulty swallowing solids, fatigue, tiredness, and loss of appetite. The patient expresses concern about potential COVID-19 exposure due to overlapping symptoms.

**Objective:**

**Assessment:**
- The patient's symptoms are consistent with a viral illness, possibly COVID-19, given the current pandemic situation and overlap of symptoms. Differential diagnoses include pharyngitis, influenza, or a common cold.
- Patient's medical history of high blood pressure, diabetes, and high cholesterol may contribute to the overall presentation of symptoms.

**Plan:**
1. Conduct a COVID-19 swab test due to symptom overlap and potential exposure.
2. Advise the patient to self-isolate for 14 days and monitor symptoms.
3. Recommend symptomatic management: stay hydrated, eat well, use Tylenol to lower fever if needed.
4. Instruct the patient to seek emergency care if symptoms worsen or if neurological symptoms develop.
5. Recommend getting the flu vaccine once the patient has recovered to prevent future infections and reduce symptom severity.
6. Follow up with the patient in 24 to 48 hours for COVID-19 test results and further management.
