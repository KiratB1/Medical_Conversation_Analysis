**Objective:**
- Vital signs stable
- No signs of distress
- No visible abnormalities
- Lung sounds clear on auscultation
- No edema in lower extremities

**Assessment:**
1. Differential diagnosis:
   - Pulmonary embolism: Considering sudden onset of symptoms, pleuritic chest pain, and shortness of breath.
   - Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD): Due to smoking history and difficulty breathing.

**Plan:**
1. Order blood work to assess for any abnormalities.
2. Schedule a chest X-ray to evaluate lung function and rule out any acute conditions.
3. Consider a pulmonary function test to assess lung capacity and airflow.
4. Monitor patient's vitals closely and provide oxygen support if necessary.
5. Advise lifestyle modifications, including smoking cessation and continued weight management.
6. Follow up with results and adjust treatment plan accordingly.
