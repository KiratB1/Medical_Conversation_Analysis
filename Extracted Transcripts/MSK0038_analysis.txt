**List of symptoms:**
- Pain in the left knee
- Sharp stabbing pain while foot hits the ground
- Pain worsens during physical activity, particularly running
- Pain now occurring at rest
- Pain rated at a 6 on a scale of 1 to 10
- Pain affecting daily activities like walking

**List of possible diseases or illnesses:**
- Iliotibial band syndrome (ITB syndrome)
- Knee overuse injury
- Patellar tendinitis
- Meniscus tear
- Runner's knee (patellofemoral pain syndrome)

**SOAP Note:**

**Subjective:**
The patient presents with a chief complaint of left knee pain that has been ongoing for the past three to four months, worsening in the past couple of weeks. The pain, described as sharp and stabbing, occurs during physical activities such as running and now at rest. The pain is rated at a 6 on a scale of 1 to 10 and is affecting daily activities like walking.

**Objective:**
- No visible redness, swelling, or bruises in the left knee area
- No muscle atrophy, deformities, or skin changes observed
- No temperature differences between the right and left knee
- Palpation reveals no pain over the kneecap or medial ligaments, but pain is elicited above the joint line on the lateral side
- No pain in the quadriceps or patellar tendon
- Pain reported when standing up and sitting down
- Ober test demonstrates tightness and limited range of motion in the iliotibial band

**Assessment:**
The patient likely presents with iliotibial band syndrome (ITB syndrome), a common overuse injury in athletes like runners. The symptoms align with ITB syndrome, including lateral knee pain exacerbated by repetitive actions like running.

**Plan:**
1. Activity modification: Consider switching to low-impact activities like swimming to reduce stress on the knee joint.
2. Ice or heat therapy: Apply ice packs or heating pads to alleviate pain and inflammation.
3. Taping and stretching exercises: Implement taping techniques and specific stretches to improve flexibility and reduce discomfort.
4. Pain relief: Recommend over-the-counter ibuprofen for temporary pain relief.
5. Physiotherapy referral: Initiate a referral for physiotherapy to strengthen the muscles around the knee joint and improve range of motion.
6. Further treatment options: If conservative measures fail, discuss additional treatments such as ultrasound therapy, muscle stimulation, or shockwave therapy. Surgical management may be considered as a last resort if necessary.
