**SOAP Note:**

**Subjective:**
The patient presents with a sore throat that started the previous night, along with difficulty swallowing, a burning sensation in the back of the throat, a raspy voice, and fatigue. The patient reports chills and a high temperature noted by the nurse upon arrival. Additionally, the patient experiences mild abdominal pain and nausea, especially when swallowing.

**Objective:**
- No reported runny nose, ear pain, headaches, chest pain, breathing difficulties, cough, muscle aches, changes in eye appearance, bowel changes, or vomiting.
- Throat examination reveals redness and swelling.
- Vital signs show an elevated temperature noted by the nurse.

**Assessment:**
1. Acute pharyngitis with possible laryngitis and viral upper respiratory infection.
2. Gastrointestinal upset contributing to mild abdominal pain and nausea.

**Plan:**
1. Recommend rest, hydration, and throat lozenges for symptomatic relief.
2. Consider a throat swab for further evaluation if symptoms persist or worsen.
3. Monitor temperature and advise on fever management.
4. Follow up in a few days for reassessment if symptoms do not improve.
5. Educate on the importance of proper nutrition despite swallowing difficulties and avoiding excessive cold foods.
6. Advise on infection control measures at home to prevent potential spread, given the patient's contact with individuals experiencing similar symptoms.
