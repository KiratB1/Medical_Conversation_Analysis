**Assessment:**
1. Differential Diagnosis:
   - Pneumonia: Considering the patient's symptoms of shortness of breath, chest pain, chills, and potential exposure to individuals with respiratory symptoms.
   - COVID-19: Given the current global situation, the possibility of COVID-19 infection cannot be ruled out.
   - Viral or bacterial respiratory infection: Differential diagnosis includes other infectious causes of respiratory symptoms.

**Plan:**
1. Perform COVID-19 testing to rule out infection.
2. Conduct blood work to assess for signs of infection.
3. Obtain chest x-ray to evaluate for pneumonia.
4. Monitor vital signs and perform a full physical examination.
5. Consider hospitalization if pneumonia is confirmed or if the patient's condition worsens, to initiate appropriate treatment and monitoring.
6. Educate the patient on symptom management and follow-up instructions.
7. Advise the patient to continue monitoring symptoms and seek medical attention if there is any deterioration.
