2. Migraine headache as a differential diagnosis due to the headache characteristics.
3. Diabetes management to be monitored closely.

**Plan:**
1. Order a COVID-19 swab test through public health to rule out infection.
2. Perform a physical examination to assess for any other possible causes of the headache.
3. Advise the patient to self-isolate and stay away from family members until COVID-19 test results are available.
4. Monitor blood sugar levels closely due to recent weight gain and potential impact on diabetes management.
5. Follow up with the patient for test results and further management accordingly.
