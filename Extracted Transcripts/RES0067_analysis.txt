**List of symptoms:**
- Persistent fever
- Difficulty swallowing
- Drooling
- Shortness of breath
- Irritability
- Paleness
- Poor appetite
- Poor sleep

**List of possible diseases or illnesses:**
- Haemophilus influenzae (H. flu) infection leading to epiglottitis
- Respiratory infection
- Possible COVID-19 infection

**SOAP Note:**

**Subjective:**
The 2-year-old patient presented with a two-day history of persistent fever, difficulty swallowing, drooling, shortness of breath, irritability, paleness, poor appetite, and poor sleep. The parent reported that the symptoms started with a fever that did not resolve despite Tylenol administration. The patient also had recent exposure to someone sick at daycare, with a prior history of a cough two weeks ago.

**Objective:**
- Fever of 38.5 degrees Celsius
- Drooling and difficulty swallowing noted
- Redness and swelling in the neck and throat area
- Paleness observed
- No coughing reported
- Irritability noted
- No signs of respiratory distress observed during the conversation

**Assessment:**
Based on the symptoms described and the concerning signs of drooling, difficulty swallowing, and shortness of breath, the patient may be experiencing epiglottitis, potentially caused by a Haemophilus influenzae (H. flu) infection. COVID-19 infection cannot be ruled out given the ongoing pandemic and the presence of respiratory symptoms.

**Plan:**
- Urgent referral to the Emergency Department for further evaluation and management.
- Request for testing for H. flu and COVID-19.
- Consideration of X-ray of the neck to assess for epiglottitis.
- Administration of appropriate antibiotics in the ER.
- Monitoring of vital signs and respiratory status to ensure stability.
- Potential hospitalization for IV antibiotics and close monitoring depending on the severity of the condition.

It is crucial to ensure prompt medical attention to address the potential airway compromise associated with epiglottitis.
