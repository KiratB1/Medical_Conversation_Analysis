**SOAP Note:**

**Subjective:**
The patient presents with a chief complaint of coughing up blood and swelling with tenderness in the right calf, which started two days after knee replacement surgery on the right leg. The patient also reports skin changes in the calf, uneasy breathing, increased heart rate, and a need for deeper breaths. No other significant symptoms reported.

**Assessment:**
1. Concern for pulmonary embolism given recent knee surgery, immobilization, coughing up blood, calf swelling, and skin changes.
2. Differential diagnosis includes deep vein thrombosis, postoperative complications, and cardiovascular conditions related to comorbidities.

**Plan:**
1. Order imaging studies, specifically a CTPA, to investigate for a pulmonary embolism.
2. Perform a physical exam, focusing on the chest and the patient's right calf.
3. Start lab work to assess for any abnormalities.
4. Monitor vital signs closely, especially heart rate and respiratory rate.
5. Educate the patient on the importance of follow-up care and adherence to prescribed medications.
6. Consider referral to a specialist for further evaluation and management if necessary.
