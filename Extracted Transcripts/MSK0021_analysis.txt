**List of symptoms:**

- No difference in temperature between knees

**List of possible diseases or illnesses:**
- Patellofemoral syndrome (most likely based on symptoms and patient's physical activities)
- Overuse injury
- Soft tissue injury around the kneecap
- Possible meniscal injury (to be ruled out with an x-ray)

**SOAP Note:**

**Subjective:**
A 7/10 sharp pain in the left knee present for the past month, worsened with activities like walking down stairs, squatting, and running. Patient reports no other significant symptoms besides crackling sounds in the knees. No history of similar pain in the past. No systemic symptoms like fevers, chills, fatigue, or weight changes. Patient is an undergraduate student living with roommates, actively engaging in running, weight lifting, and cycling.

**Objective:**
Physical examination reveals no redness, swelling, atrophy, or deformities in the left knee. Pain elicited on palpation of the kneecap. No difference in temperature between knees. Pain with standing up and squatting, but not with bending or flexing hips. Crackling sounds noted in the knees.

**Assessment:**
Likely diagnosis of Patellofemoral syndrome based on symptoms and physical examination findings. Rule out meniscal injury with an x-ray due to persistent sharp pain.

**Plan:**
1. Advise the patient to avoid running and switch to low-impact activities like stationary biking or swimming.
2. Recommend RICE method (Rest, Ice, Compression, Elevation) for pain management.
3. Prescribe ibuprofen for pain relief.
4. Order an x-ray to rule out other underlying issues.
5. Refer the patient to physiotherapy for range of motion and strength training.
6. Consider arthroscopy or surgical intervention if nonsurgical treatments are ineffective.
