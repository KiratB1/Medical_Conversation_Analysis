**SOAP Note:**

**Subjective:**
The patient brought in their son due to a cough that has been ongoing for a few days, accompanied by a runny nose. The patient noticed the child tugging at his ear more in the past two days. The child has been irritable, with decreased appetite and a fever over 38 degrees Celsius. No other significant symptoms reported.

**Objective:**
- Clear and watery nasal discharge
- Dry cough
- No harsh cough sounds noted
- No changes in vision or hearing
- No rashes, shortness of breath, wheezing, or ear discharge
- Normal bowel movements and urine
- No signs of swelling in the ear
- Normal growth and development milestones
- No medications or allergies reported
- Up to date with immunizations
- Family history negative for lung or heart conditions
- Exposure to secondhand smoke
- No environmental triggers identified

**Assessment:**
1. Acute upper respiratory infection with viral etiology
2. Likely acute otitis media (ear infection) based on tugging at the ear, irritability, and fever
3. Rule out COVID-19 due to overlapping symptoms
4. Consideration for antibiotic treatment based on physical exam findings

**Plan:**
1. Perform a physical examination, including an otoscopic evaluation of the ear.
2. Swab for COVID-19 testing to rule out infection.
3. Prescribe amoxicillin for a 10-day course if signs of middle ear effusion, bulging tympanic membrane, or perforation are present.
4. Advise reassessment in 24-48 hours if the child does not show significant improvement.
5. Follow up with the patient for test results and treatment effectiveness.
