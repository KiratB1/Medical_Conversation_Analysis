**List of symptoms:**
- Pain in the chest
- Trouble breathing
- Cough
- Shortness of breath on exertion
- Racing heart sensation
- Left leg soreness
- Swelling in the left leg

**List of possible diseases or illnesses:**
- Pulmonary embolism
- Chest infection
- Pneumonia
- Acute coronary syndrome
- Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
- Heart failure

**SOAP Note:**

**Subjective:**
The patient, Jen, is a 52-year-old female presenting with chest pain for over a week, associated with trouble breathing, exacerbated by deep breaths and exertion. She reports a cough and shortness of breath on exertion, rating it as high as 7-8 out of 10. She denies fevers, chills, night sweats, weight loss, changes in vision, hearing, smell, or skin. She mentions a history of hysterectomy a few weeks ago due to fibroids. The patient smokes about half a pack of cigarettes per day, has a family history of heart attack in her mother at age 56, and reports swelling in her left leg.

**Objective:**
- Patient appears uncomfortable during the conversation.
- No signs of distress or acute respiratory distress.
- No visible swelling in the left leg during the conversation.
- No wheezing or coughing during the conversation.
- No fever or tachycardia noted.

**Assessment:**
1. Differential diagnosis includes pulmonary embolism, chest infection, pneumonia, acute coronary syndrome, COPD, and heart failure given the patient's symptoms of chest pain, cough, shortness of breath, and racing heart sensation.
2. Smoking history and family history of heart attack increase the risk for cardiovascular conditions.
3. Recent hysterectomy may contribute to reduced mobility and increased risk of blood clots.

**Plan:**
1. Immediate referral for further diagnostic testing including chest imaging, pulmonary function tests, and D-dimer to rule out pulmonary embolism.
2. Consideration for cardiac workup including ECG and cardiac enzymes to evaluate for acute coronary syndrome.
3. Monitor for signs of infection and consider antibiotics if indicated.
4. Advise the patient to elevate her left leg and consider compression stockings for swelling.
5. Provide smoking cessation resources and counseling.
6. Follow-up appointment to review test results and adjust treatment plan accordingly.
