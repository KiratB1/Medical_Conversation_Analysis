**List of possible diseases or illnesses:**

**SOAP Note:**

**Subjective:**
- A 10th-grade student presented with left knee pain that started after a basketball injury during practice about 6 hours ago.
- The patient described hearing a pop in the knee while landing for a rebound, followed by immediate sharp pain.
- Pain is localized to the left knee, with swelling, bruising, and inability to bear weight.
- Pain is sharp and rated 9-10 out of 10, exacerbated by knee movements.

**Objective:**
- Physical examination reveals bruising and swelling around the left knee.
- Limited range of motion with pain on flexion, extension, and weight-bearing.
- No signs of warmth to touch or systemic symptoms noted.

**Assessment:**
- Suspected knee ligament injury, likely anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury based on mechanism of injury and symptoms reported by the patient.

**Plan:**
1. Order an MRI of the knee to assess the extent of ligament damage.
2. Depending on MRI findings, consider conservative management or surgical intervention.
3. Educate the patient on the importance of rest, ice, elevation, and possibly crutches for mobility support.
4. Follow up with the patient post-MRI to discuss treatment options and further management.

Note: The patient's history of previous ankle sprains and family history of musculoskeletal conditions (rotator cuff injury in father) may be relevant for future considerations in treatment and rehabilitation.
