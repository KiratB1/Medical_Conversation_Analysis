3. Consideration of oral contraceptive-related side effects and allergic reaction to Septra.

**Plan:**
1. Order chest X-Ray and sputum culture to evaluate for tuberculosis.
2. Initiate blood work to assess for any underlying infections or inflammatory markers.
3. Provide smoking cessation counseling and resources for quitting.
4. Follow up with the patient for test results and further management based on findings.
