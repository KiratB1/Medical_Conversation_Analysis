**List of symptoms:**
- Nonstop coughing for the past three days
- Feeling very short of breath
- Yellow sputum
- Wheezing

**List of possible diseases or illnesses:**
- Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) exacerbation
- Respiratory tract infection
- COVID-19 (considering overlap of symptoms)

**SOAP Note:**

**Subjective:**
The patient presents with a three-day history of nonstop coughing, shortness of breath, and yellow sputum production. The cough has been worsening over the past few days, with associated wheezing. The patient reports a history of COPD diagnosed five years ago and a similar episode of respiratory symptoms in the past.

**Objective:**
- Patient is alert and oriented.
- No signs of distress observed.
- Vital signs stable.
- Patient reports no recent weight changes, fevers, chills, night sweats, chest pain, lightheadedness, or other systemic symptoms.

**Assessment:**
1. Likely COPD exacerbation given the patient's history of COPD, worsening cough, yellow sputum, and wheezing.
2. Differential diagnosis includes respiratory tract infection and possible COVID-19 due to overlapping symptoms.

**Plan:**
1. Obtain chest x-ray to evaluate lung status.
2. Perform lab work to aid in diagnosis.
3. Initiate inhalers to help open airways and improve breathing.
4. Prescribe antibiotics and steroids if COPD exacerbation is confirmed.
5. Conduct a COVID-19 nasal swab test to rule out infection.
6. Monitor oxygen levels and consider supplemental oxygen if necessary.
7. Advise the patient to follow up for further evaluation and management.
