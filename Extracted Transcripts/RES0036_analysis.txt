**List of possible diseases or illnesses:**

**SOAP Note:**

**Subjective:**
The patient presents with a history of breathlessness, coughing, rusty colored sputum, wheezing, sharp chest pain exacerbated by coughing, chills, and nocturnal chills. The patient denies significant weight loss, dizziness, fainting spells, but reports a recent runny nose.

**Objective:**
- Wheezing noted during examination
- Patient reports sharp chest pain rated at 7 on a scale of 1 to 10, worsening with coughing
- No other significant physical findings noted

**Assessment:**
1. Upper respiratory tract infection
2. COPD exacerbation
3. Potential exposure-related lung conditions (mold, asbestos)
4. Smoking-related respiratory issues

**Plan:**
1. Conduct investigations to determine the underlying cause of symptoms.
2. Consider prescribing antibiotics if bacterial infection is suspected.
3. Evaluate lung function and consider management for COPD exacerbation.
4. Discuss smoking cessation strategies and potential referral to a pulmonologist for further evaluation.
5. Advise on lifestyle modifications, including improving diet quality and reducing exposure to potential lung irritants.
