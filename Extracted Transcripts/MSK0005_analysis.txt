**List of symptoms:**
- Pain on the outside of the right elbow
- Increased pain over several months
- Pain worsens with bending the wrist down or holding heavy objects
- Aching pain with occasional sharpness
- Pain rated at a level of 4 out of 10
- Pain has been progressively worsening

**List of possible diseases or illnesses:**
- Lateral epicondylitis (tennis elbow) due to repetitive strain on the extensor forearm muscles

**SOAP Note:**

**Subjective:**
The patient presents with a complaint of pain on the outside of the right elbow that started several months ago and has been progressively worsening. The pain is described as aching with occasional sharpness, exacerbated by bending the wrist down or holding heavy objects at work, where the patient performs repetitive tasks. Pain is alleviated with rest and the use of ibuprofen. The pain is rated at a level of 4 out of 10 and has not been experienced before. The patient has tried over-the-counter remedies and topical ointments for pain relief.

**Objective:**
- Full range of motion in the right elbow and hand
- No redness, swelling, numbness, tingling, or asymmetry observed in the right elbow
- Palpation elicits pain at the lateral aspect of the elbow
- Pain with wrist extension and flexion, but no pain with elbow flexion
- No pain with palpation of the forearm and biceps
- No hot sensation or deformities noted
- Normal shoulder movements and forearm pronation/supination
- No other joint or muscle pains reported

**Assessment:**
The patient likely presents with lateral epicondylitis (tennis elbow) due to repetitive strain on the extensor forearm muscles, exacerbated by work-related activities. There is no evidence of fractures or other underlying conditions based on the clinical evaluation.

**Plan:**
1. Activity modifications at work to avoid repetitive strain on the extensor forearm muscles.
2. Use of a compression sleeve for support.
3. Continued use of pain relief medication such as ibuprofen.
4. Referral for physical therapy to improve mobility and strength in the affected arm.
5. Application of ice for pain and swelling management.
6. Follow-up in a few weeks to monitor progress and adjust treatment as needed.
