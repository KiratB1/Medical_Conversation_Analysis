**SOAP Note:**

**Subjective:**
A 5-year-old male patient presented with a dry cough that started three days ago, accompanied by fatigue and a fever over 100 degrees. The patient's parent mentioned a runny nose, loss of appetite, and possible loss of taste. No other significant symptoms reported.

**Objective:**
- Vital signs: Fever recorded over 100 degrees.
- Physical examination: No wheezing, shortness of breath, chest pain, or other concerning symptoms noted.

**Assessment:**
- Likely viral respiratory infection such as a common cold or COVID-19 given the symptoms of dry cough, fever, and fatigue.
- COVID-19 testing recommended due to the presence of symptoms and potential exposure at school.
- Differential diagnosis includes other viral illnesses.

**Plan:**
1. Conduct a COVID-19 swab test to confirm the presence of the virus.
2. Advise the patient to isolate for 14 days, including from family members, pending test results.
3. Monitor symptoms closely for any worsening, especially high fever, neurological symptoms, weakness, or dizziness.
4. Educate the parent on the possibility of false negatives and the need for further evaluation if symptoms deteriorate.
5. Await test results and provide appropriate management based on the outcome.
