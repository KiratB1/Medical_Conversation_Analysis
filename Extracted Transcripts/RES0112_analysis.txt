1. Initiate antibiotic therapy to address possible bacterial infection.
2. Administer IV fluids to correct dehydration and ensure adequate hydration.
3. Monitor closely for signs of respiratory distress and provide supportive care as needed.
4. Perform further investigations as necessary to determine the underlying cause of symptoms.
5. Educate the parent on signs of deterioration and when to seek further medical attention.
