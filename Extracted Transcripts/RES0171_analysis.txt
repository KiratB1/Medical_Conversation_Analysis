**SOAP Note:**

**Subjective:**
The patient presents with complaints of shortness of breath, difficulty breathing at rest and with exertion, chest pain exacerbated by deep breaths, dry cough, and a fast heart rate. She also reports a sore right calf. The symptoms started yesterday and have been progressively worsening. The patient has a history of anxiety, type 2 diabetes, and a recent hysterectomy for abnormal bleeding. She has a high BMI and is a smoker.

**Objective:**
- Patient appears alert and oriented.
- Vital signs: Elevated heart rate.
- Soreness in the right calf noted upon examination.
- No signs of redness, warmth, or swelling in the right calf.
- No other physical abnormalities observed.

**Assessment:**
1. Pulmonary embolism: Suspected due to recent surgery, immobility, shortness of breath, and fast heart rate. Risk factors include smoking and high BMI.
2. Deep vein thrombosis: Considered as a potential cause of the sore right calf, which could lead to pulmonary embolism.
3. Anxiety: Patient's history of anxiety may contribute to the presentation of symptoms.
4. Type 2 diabetes: Chronic condition requiring monitoring and management.

**Plan:**
1. Conduct an ultrasound of the leg to assess for deep vein thrombosis.
2. Perform a scan of the chest to confirm the presence of a pulmonary embolism.
3. Consider initiating blood thinning medications if a clot is confirmed.
4. Encourage the patient to continue efforts to quit smoking and manage her weight to reduce the risk of future complications.
5. Follow up with the patient to discuss test results and adjust treatment plan accordingly.
