**Assessment:**
1. Respiratory symptoms including worsening dry cough and shortness of breath suggest a respiratory infection such as acute bronchitis, pneumonia, or possibly COVID-19.
2. Gastrointestinal symptoms of diarrhea for the last three days may be indicative of an infectious etiology.

**Plan:**
1. Conduct a COVID-19 test to rule out infection, with results expected in 24-48 hours.
2. Recommend isolation for 14 days, including distancing from the patient's wife, to prevent potential spread of infection.
3. Advise monitoring for worsening symptoms, especially neurological symptoms, high fever, or severe breathing difficulties. Instruct the patient to seek emergency care if these symptoms develop.
4. Follow up with the patient after COVID-19 test results and provide further management based on the outcome.
