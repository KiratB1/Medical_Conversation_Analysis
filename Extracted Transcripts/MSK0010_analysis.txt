**List of possible diseases or illnesses:**

**SOAP Note:**

**Subjective:**
The patient presents with a chief complaint of left shoulder pain that started 5 days ago, with a history of progressive pain over the last few weeks. The pain is located in the front part of the shoulder and worsens with lifting or carrying objects. The patient describes the pain as achy but can become sharp with certain movements. There is a history of overuse injury in the left shoulder from playing tennis a couple of years ago.

**Objective:**
- Positive findings on physical exam: Painful arc from 60 to 120 degrees during shoulder abduction, positive Jobe's test, positive Neer's test, pain with internal rotation of the arm, and pain on palpation at the front of the shoulder.
- Strength slightly reduced in the left arm.

**Assessment:**
Based on the patient's symptoms, history of overuse injury, and physical exam findings, the likely diagnoses are a rotator cuff tear or rotator cuff impingement syndrome.

**Plan:**
1. Order an ultrasound of the left shoulder to evaluate the structures.
2. Consider additional imaging such as X-ray or MRI to determine the extent of the injury in the left shoulder.
