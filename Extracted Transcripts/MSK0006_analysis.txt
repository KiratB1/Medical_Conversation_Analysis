**List of symptoms:**

- Pain radiating down the right leg
- Pain worsens with walking, sitting, and movements
- Sharp pain in the buttock and burning sensation down the leg
- Leg weakness and difficulty walking
- Numbness and tingling down the right leg

**List of possible diseases or illnesses:**
- Sciatica
- Sacral nerve radiculopathy
- Lower lumbar radiculopathy

**SOAP Note:**

**Subjective:**
The patient presents with intense pain in the right buttock area that radiates down the right leg. The pain has worsened over the last 2 days and is described as sharp in the buttock and burning down the leg. The patient also reports leg weakness, difficulty walking, and numbness and tingling down the right leg. The pain is persistent and exacerbated by walking, sitting, and movements.

**Objective:**
- Physical examination reveals tenderness over the buttock area.
- Gait assessment shows antalgic gait with limping and more pressure on the left foot.
- Pain is elicited with hip extension, hip flexion, and plantar flexion of the right foot.
- No swelling, redness, skin changes, atrophy, or deformity observed.
- No weakness, urinary or stool incontinence, or sexual dysfunction reported.

**Assessment:**
1. Sciatica: The patient's symptoms of intense pain in the buttock area radiating down the leg, along with numbness and tingling, are consistent with sciatica, likely due to compression of the sciatic nerve roots.
2. Lower lumbar radiculopathy: Differential diagnosis includes lower lumbar radiculopathy, considering the patient's occupation as a truck driver and history of sciatic pain.

**Plan:**
1. Conservative management: Initiate NSAIDs for pain management, activity modification, and referral to physical therapy for exercises and activity modification.
2. Follow-up: Reevaluate in 6 to 8 weeks to assess response to conservative measures. Consider steroid injections and imaging if symptoms persist or red flags develop.
3. Lifestyle modification: Encourage smoking cessation and limit alcohol consumption for overall health improvement.
4. Patient education: Educate the patient on the importance of adherence to treatment, activity modification, and recognizing red flags for prompt medical attention.
