**SOAP Note:**

**Subjective:**
The patient presents with a complaint of worsening pain in the right elbow over the past three days. The pain is described as achy when the wrist is not extended and sharp on the outside of the elbow when the wrist is extended. The pain is exacerbated by gripping motion and activities, rated at 6-7 out of 10, and improves with rest. The patient has tried Advil for pain relief, with temporary relief but recurrence of pain.

**Plan:**
1. Activity modification to avoid repetitive movements that exacerbate the pain.
2. Prescribe ibuprofen for pain management.
3. Referral to physiotherapy for strengthening exercises and rehabilitation.
4. Follow-up in 6 to 12 months to assess response to conservative management before considering operative intervention if needed.
