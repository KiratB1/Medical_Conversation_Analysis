**SOAP Note:**

**Subjective:**
The patient, a 26-year-old male, presents with complaints of back pain that has been ongoing for the past few months. He describes the pain as dull and affecting his entire back, mainly from the middle to lower regions. He reports stiffness in the morning, which improves within 30 to 60 minutes of waking up. The pain is rated around 4 to 5 on a scale of 0 to 10 and is not associated with any specific triggers. The patient also mentions feeling fatigued and experiencing malaise, which have been progressively worsening over time. He denies any trauma, recent fevers, chills, night sweats, changes in bowel movements or urinary patterns, numbness, tingling, muscle weakness, shortness of breath, rashes, weight changes, vision problems, or joint swelling.

**Objective:**
- No visible signs of redness or swelling in the affected areas.
- Patient reports stiffness but no significant limitation in bending or extending movements during examination.

**Assessment:**
1. Differential diagnosis:
   - Psoriatic arthritis
   - Reactive arthritis
   - Ankylosing spondylitis

**Plan:**
1. Physical examination to assess joint mobility and inflammation.
2. X-ray of the spine and sacroiliac joints to evaluate for structural abnormalities.
3. Blood work including CBC, CRP, ESR, rheumatoid factor, and antinuclear antibodies to assess for inflammatory markers and autoimmune conditions.
4. X-ray of hands and knees to investigate pain in those areas.
5. Follow-up appointment to discuss test results and determine appropriate treatment plan.
