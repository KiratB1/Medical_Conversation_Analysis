**SOAP Note:**

**Subjective:**
The patient presents with complaints of neck pain that started after a minor car accident in a parking lot. The pain is described as sharp, worsens with movement, and is accompanied by tenderness in the trapezius muscle area and upper back. The patient reports no previous history of similar pain.

**Objective:**
- No visible redness, swelling, or muscle atrophy noted on examination.
- Tenderness in trapezius muscle area and front of the neck observed on palpation.
- Pain reported on flexion, extension, and lateral flexion of the neck, with stiffness noted during range of motion testing.

**Assessment:**
- Likely diagnosis of whiplash injury or muscle strain/sprain in the neck following a low-impact car accident.
- Rule out cervical spine injury or fractures/dislocations with X-ray.

**Plan:**
1. Order X-ray to rule out fractures or dislocations.
2. Pain management:
   - Rest.
   - Apply heat or cold packs to the neck.
   - Over-the-counter pain medications like Ibuprofen or Tylenol.
   - Consider injections for pain relief if necessary.
3. Physiotherapy for range of motion exercises, muscle strengthening, posture improvement, and normal movement.
4. Follow-up to assess response to initial management and discuss alternative treatment options if needed.
