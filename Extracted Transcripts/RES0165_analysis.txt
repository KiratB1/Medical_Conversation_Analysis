**SOAP Note:**

**Subjective:**
The patient presents with a two-day history of cough, sore throat, and runny nose. The cough is dry and has been worsening over the past day and a half. The patient also reports muscle aches, mild fatigue, and onset of a runny nose about an hour or two ago. Symptoms are intermittent and not worsening significantly, with a slight increase in severity. No shortness of breath, chest pain, dizziness, or other concerning symptoms reported.

**Objective:**
- Patient appears generally well, no signs of distress
- Vital signs within normal limits
- No signs of respiratory distress
- Throat examination shows mild irritation, no visible exudates or swelling
- Lungs clear to auscultation
- No lymphadenopathy noted

**Assessment:**
1. Viral upper respiratory tract infection, likely common cold or influenza, given the patient's symptoms of cough, sore throat, runny nose, and muscle aches.
2. Consideration for COVID-19 testing due to the patient's occupation in a hospital setting and overlapping symptoms with viral illnesses.

**Plan:**
1. Conduct a COVID-19 swab test for the patient to rule out infection.
2. Recommend over-the-counter medications like Tylenol cold for symptom management.
3. Advise the patient to stay hydrated and get adequate rest.
4. Instruct the patient to monitor symptoms and seek medical attention if symptoms worsen.
5. Follow up with the patient to discuss test results and provide further guidance as needed.
