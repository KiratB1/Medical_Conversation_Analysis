**Assessment:**
Based on the patient's history, symptoms, and physical examination, the likely diagnosis is a tibial fracture. Further imaging studies, such as X-rays, are recommended to confirm the diagnosis and assess the extent of the fracture.

**Plan:**
1. Order X-rays to determine the location and severity of the tibial fracture.
2. Apply a splint to stabilize the leg until swelling subsides.
3. Refer the patient to an orthopedic surgeon for further evaluation and potential surgical intervention, such as intramedullary nail, plates, and screws fixation.

5. Follow up with the patient regularly to monitor progress and adjust the treatment plan as needed.
