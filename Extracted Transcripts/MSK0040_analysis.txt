**List of symptoms:**

- Inability to bear weight
- Sharp pain at lateral malleolus area

**List of possible diseases or illnesses:**

- Ankle sprain

**SOAP Note:**

**Subjective:**
The patient presents with a chief complaint of right ankle pain following a rugby injury where the foot turned inwards during a tackle motion. The pain is sharp, localized to the lateral malleolus area, and rated at 7-8 out of 10. The pain worsens with weight-bearing and is temporarily relieved by ibuprofen and ice. The patient denies any previous ankle injuries or similar pain.

**Objective:**
- Swelling and bruising observed on the right ankle, with a 4 cm wide bruise and slight warmth noted.
- Pin-point tenderness at the lateral malleolus.
- Limited dorsiflexion and painful planter flexion.
- Limping gait with an antalgic pattern and inability to bear weight on the affected ankle.

**Assessment:**
Based on the patient's history and physical examination findings, differential diagnoses include an ankle fracture or ankle sprain. Given the pin-point tenderness and inability to bear weight, an X-Ray is recommended to rule out a fracture.

**Plan:**
1. Order X-Ray of the right ankle to assess for any fractures.
2. Prescribe pain management as needed.
3. If a fracture is confirmed, consider immobilization with an air boot or casting for bone healing.
4. Follow up with the patient for X-Ray results and further management.
