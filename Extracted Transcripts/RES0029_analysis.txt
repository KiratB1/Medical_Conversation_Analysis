**List of symptoms:**
- Pain in the left side of the chest
- Pain described as stabbing
- Difficulty breathing deeply
- Feeling of not being able to catch breath
- Heart racing more than usual in the last hour

**List of possible diseases or illnesses:**
- Chest injury/trauma
- Rib fracture
- Pneumothorax
- Pulmonary contusion
- Cardiac-related issues (such as myocardial infarction or angina)

**SOAP Note:**

**Subjective:**
The patient presents with chest pain on the left side that started approximately 2 hours ago after falling off a bicycle. The pain is described as stabbing and worsens with deep breathing. The patient also reports difficulty catching breath and feeling like the heart is racing more than usual.

**Objective:**
- No loss of consciousness or head injuries reported
- No fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, cough, recent infections, dizziness, weakness, numbness, or tingling noted
- Skin changes limited to minor scrapes on the hands
- No recent alcohol or drug intake, except for occasional alcohol consumption
- Patient smokes 2.5 to 3 packs of cigarettes per day, has a history of hay fever and allergies to nasal sprays and antihistamines
- Family history of type 2 diabetes in the father
- Occupation as a mechanic, living alone in an apartment

**Assessment:**
1. The patient likely experienced chest trauma due to the fall from the bicycle, leading to chest pain and potential rib fracture.
2. Considering the stabbing pain and worsening with deep breathing, pulmonary issues like pneumothorax or pulmonary contusion cannot be ruled out.
3. Cardiac-related conditions such as myocardial infarction or angina should also be considered due to the location and nature of the pain.

**Plan:**
1. Immediate evaluation for chest trauma, including imaging studies like chest X-ray to assess for rib fractures or lung injuries.
2. Monitor vital signs, oxygen saturation, and cardiac rhythm closely.
3. Consider cardiac enzymes and ECG to rule out myocardial infarction.
4. Pain management and breathing assistance as needed.
5. Smoking cessation counseling and referral for further evaluation of respiratory symptoms and cardiac risk factors.
