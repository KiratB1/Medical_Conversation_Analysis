**List of possible diseases or illnesses:**
- Patellar tendonitis (Jumpers knee)
- Overuse injury

- Ligament injury

**SOAP Note:**

**Subjective:**
The patient presents with a chief complaint of persistent knee pain for a few weeks, localized below the right kneecap. The pain is aching in nature, worsens with activity, and reaches a level of 6-7 out of 10. The pain is specifically sharp when pressure is applied to a specific spot. The patient notes limitations in playing basketball and experiences soreness after prolonged sitting. Additionally, the patient mentions tightness in thigh and hamstring muscles.

**Objective:**
- No visible swelling, redness, or bruising in the knee area.
- No weakness reported in the legs.
- No numbness, tingling, weakness, or changes in bowel/urinary patterns.
- Full range of motion in knee flexion and extension.
- No noted issues with ankle or hip movements.
- No signs of trauma or recent injuries to the knee.

**Assessment:**
1. Patellar tendonitis (Jumpers knee) is suspected based on the patient's presentation of knee pain localized below the kneecap, worsened by activity, and tenderness to palpation.
2. Muscle tightness in thigh and hamstring muscles may be contributing to the symptoms.

**Plan:**
1. Conservative management with rest, ice application for 4-6 times a day, and elevation as needed.
2. Recommend continuing Tylenol, Advil, or NSAIDs for pain relief as directed.
3. Referral to physiotherapy for strengthening and stretching exercises to address patellar tendonitis and muscle tightness.
4. Follow-up to monitor response to treatment; consider imaging (ultrasound or MRI) if symptoms persist or worsen.
5. Educate the patient on the importance of proper warm-up, stretching, and gradual return to sports activities to prevent recurrence.
6. Emphasize the importance of compliance with the treatment plan and physiotherapy regimen.
