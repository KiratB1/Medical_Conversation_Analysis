**List of symptoms:**

- Feverishness

**List of possible diseases or illnesses:**
- Pharyngitis
- Viral infection with possible superimposed bacterial infection

**SOAP Note:**

**Subjective:**
The patient presents with a sore throat that started four days ago, accompanied by a dry cough that began a week prior. The cough has slightly improved, but the sore throat has worsened. The patient reports experiencing fatigue, body aches, feverishness, itchy eyes, and a runny nose. There is a history of recurrent tonsillitis, with the last episode occurring six months ago.

**Objective:**
- Vital signs: Temperature measured at 38.2Â°C yesterday
- No reported chest pain, difficulty breathing, changes in smell or taste
- No recent surgeries or hospitalizations
- Allergic to peanuts with a history of anaphylaxis

**Assessment:**
1. Likely diagnosis of pharyngitis with possible streptococcal infection given the sore throat, fever, and history of recurrent tonsillitis.
2. Differential diagnosis includes a viral infection with a superimposed bacterial infection.
3. Rule out COVID-19 with a rapid test due to the presence of respiratory symptoms and fever.

**Plan:**
1. Perform a physical examination including throat inspection and chest auscultation.
2. Conduct a rapid strep test and COVID-19 test.
3. Advise the patient to self-isolate at home until test results are available.
4. Prescribe symptomatic treatment for pain relief and fever management.
5. Follow up with the patient once test results are obtained to determine further management.
