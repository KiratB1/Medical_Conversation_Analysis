**SOAP Note:**

**Subjective:**
The patient, a 25-year-old male, presents with a sharp pain in the chest that started three days ago. The pain is localized over the heart and worsens when coughing or laying down. It lasts for a few seconds and then resolves, improving when leaning forward. The pain radiates to the neck. The patient reports a recent history of flu symptoms but currently denies any respiratory or systemic symptoms. He rates the chest pain as a 6 out of 10. The patient is concerned about the possibility of a heart attack due to a family history of his father having a recent fatal heart attack.

**Objective:**
- Vital signs: Stable
- No signs of distress
- No visible abnormalities on chest examination
- No palpable chest tenderness or swelling
- No respiratory distress or abnormal lung sounds

**Assessment:**
1. Chest pain likely musculoskeletal or non-cardiac in nature, given the patient's age and absence of typical cardiac symptoms.
2. Differential diagnosis includes costochondritis, pleurisy, GERD, and post-viral chest pain.
3. Family history of heart attack raises concern for acute coronary syndrome, warranting further investigation.

**Plan:**
1. Order an ECG to evaluate cardiac function.
2. Consider further diagnostic tests such as blood work if indicated.
3. Advise the patient to monitor symptoms and follow up for review of test results.
4. Provide reassurance and support regarding anxiety related to family history.
5. Educate the patient on chest pain management techniques and lifestyle modifications.
6. Follow up with the patient to discuss test results and develop a comprehensive treatment plan.
