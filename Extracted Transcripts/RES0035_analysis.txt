**SOAP Note:**

**Subjective:**
The patient presents with a chief complaint of difficulty breathing and a wet cough that has been ongoing for the past 8 months. The cough has worsened over time and is associated with the production of clear, yellow, or green phlegm. The patient reports fatigue from coughing, exacerbated symptoms with walking, and a history of asthma and smoking. There are no other significant symptoms reported.

**Objective:**
- Patient appears well-nourished and in no acute distress.
- Respiratory rate slightly elevated at rest.
- Lung auscultation reveals wheezing.
- No signs of respiratory distress observed.
- Vital signs within normal limits.

**Assessment:**
1. Chronic bronchitis exacerbation likely due to smoking history and environmental exposure.
2. Asthma exacerbation contributing to the patient's symptoms.
3. Possible COPD given the chronic nature of symptoms and smoking history.

**Plan:**
1. Recommend immediate cessation of smoking to improve respiratory symptoms.
2. Prescribe bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroids for asthma management.
3. Order pulmonary function tests to assess lung function and confirm diagnosis.
4. Provide education on proper inhaler technique and self-management strategies.
5. Follow up in 2 weeks to monitor response to treatment and adjust management as needed.
6. Advise regular monitoring of blood pressure and blood glucose levels due to underlying conditions.
