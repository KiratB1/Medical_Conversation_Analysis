**List of possible diseases or illnesses:**
- Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
- Pulmonary fibrosis due to possible asbestos exposure
- Connective tissue disease (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, lupus)

**SOAP Note:**

**Subjective:**
- Patient, a 75-year-old male, presents with a dry cough persisting for six months, increasing in frequency over the last few months.
- Reports fatigue, joint pain in hands and feet, weight loss over the last three to four months, and limited energy levels affecting physical activities.

**Assessment:**
1. Chronic dry cough with increasing frequency over time.
2. Fatigue, weight loss, and joint pain suggestive of underlying systemic condition.
3. Possible asbestos exposure leading to pulmonary fibrosis.
4. Consideration of connective tissue disease given joint symptoms.

**Plan:**
1. Order chest X-ray and chest CT to evaluate for pulmonary fibrosis.
2. Conduct laboratory investigations to assess for autoimmune markers.
3. Referral to a pulmonologist for further evaluation and management.
4. Follow-up appointment to discuss test results and treatment options.
