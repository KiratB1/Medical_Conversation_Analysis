**List of symptoms:**
- Daughter walking funny with a limp
- Pain in right leg, especially near the top of the leg and hip
- Refusal to put weight on right leg
- Anxiety and irritability due to pain
- Recent history of runny nose, cough, and fever
- Feeling warm recently

**List of possible diseases or illnesses:**
- Transient synovitis
- Septic arthritis
- Legg-Calve-Perthes disease

**SOAP Note:**

**Subjective:**
- 5-year-old daughter of the patient presented with a history of walking with a limp and experiencing significant pain in the right leg, particularly near the top of the leg and hip. The patient reported that the symptoms started two days ago and have worsened, leading to the daughter being unable to bear weight on the affected leg. The daughter also exhibited signs of anxiety and irritability due to the pain. Additionally, there was a recent history of runny nose, cough, and a mild fever.

**Objective:**
- No visible swelling, redness, muscle atrophy, misalignment, or deformity noted around the right hip.
- No significant pain on palpation over the hip or knee.
- Daughter able to move the hip and knee with a full range of motion, but experiences pain when putting weight on the leg.
- No muscle weakness observed during testing around the joint.

**Assessment:**
- Differential diagnosis includes transient synovitis, septic arthritis, and Legg-Calve-Perthes disease. Transient synovitis is considered likely due to the recent viral infection and mild fever, but septic arthritis and Legg-Calve-Perthes disease need to be ruled out.
- Past history of developmental dysplasia of the hip noted but resolved without ongoing issues.

**Plan:**
1. Recommend anti-inflammatories such as ibuprofen for pain relief.
2. Monitor for any worsening symptoms, including high fever or red, hot swollen joint, which may indicate septic arthritis.
3. Follow up for reassessment if symptoms persist or daughter's condition deteriorates.
4. Educate the patient on signs of potential complications and the importance of prompt medical attention if needed.
