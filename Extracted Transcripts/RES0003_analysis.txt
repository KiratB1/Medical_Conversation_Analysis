**SOAP Note:**

**Subjective:**
A 3-year-old male patient, Joey, presents with a sore throat persisting for the last three days. Mother reports he has been experiencing difficulty swallowing, reduced appetite for solid food, and a high fever of 39.4°C. No complaints of neck pain, chills, night sweats, cough, body aches, headaches, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or constipation. Mother notes redness in the back of the throat and a husky voice. No history of similar symptoms to this severity in the past.

**Objective:**
- Vital signs: High fever of 39.4°C
- No visible swelling in the neck or rashes
- No chills, night sweats, cough, body aches, headaches, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or constipation
- Redness observed in the back of the throat
- Husky voice noted

**Assessment:**
- Likely diagnosis of strep throat given the symptoms of sore throat, difficulty swallowing, and high fever. Viral pharyngitis also considered in the differential diagnosis.
- Rule out other causes of pharyngitis based on further testing.

**Plan:**
1. Perform a rapid strep test to confirm or rule out strep throat.
2. Consider further investigations if rapid strep test is inconclusive.
3. Provide symptomatic relief with pain management and encourage adequate fluid intake.
4. Follow up with the patient in a few days to monitor symptom progression and treatment effectiveness.
5. Educate the parent on the importance of completing the prescribed treatment course and the contagious nature of strep throat.
