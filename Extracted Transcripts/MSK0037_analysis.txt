**List of symptoms:**
- Difficulties with right hand, especially at the bases of the 4th and 5th digits
- Trouble extending 4th and 5th fingers
- Bump at the base of 4th and 5th fingers
- Aching pain that worsens with finger extension
- Catching sensation when trying to extend the fingers

**List of possible diseases or illnesses:**
- Dupuytren's contracture
- Flexor tenosynovitis
- Trigger finger

**SOAP Note:**

**Subjective:**
The patient, a construction worker, presents with difficulties in his right hand, specifically at the bases of the 4th and 5th digits. He reports trouble extending these two fingers, along with the presence of a bump at their base. The symptoms have been ongoing for the last few months and have been progressively worsening. The patient describes the pain as aching, exacerbated by finger extension, with a catching sensation during extension. No radiation of pain, weakness, fevers, or chills reported.

**Objective:**
- No visible swelling or redness noted in the hand
- Nodules present at the base of the 4th and 5th fingers
- Discomfort upon palpation at the bases of the affected fingers
- Pain with passive extension of the fingers, more pronounced than active extension
- No crepitations or crackling felt over the nodules

**Assessment:**
Based on the patient's history and clinical presentation, the likely diagnosis is Dupuytren's contracture, although flexor tenosynovitis and trigger finger are also considered. The absence of certain symptoms like fevers, pain along the tendons, and swelling suggests a less likely diagnosis of tenosynovitis. Further investigations such as blood work may be needed to confirm the diagnosis.

**Plan:**
1. Recommend physiotherapy and activity modification to address Dupuytren's contracture.
2. Monitor symptoms and response to therapy.
3. Consider additional diagnostic tests if necessary to rule out other conditions.
4. Follow-up appointment scheduled to assess progress and adjust treatment plan as needed.
