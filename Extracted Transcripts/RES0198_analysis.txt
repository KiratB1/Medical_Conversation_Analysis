**List of symptoms:**
- Stuffy nose
- Runny nose
- Congestion
- Clear nasal drainage
- Fatigue

**List of possible diseases or illnesses:**
- Common cold (viral infection)
- Possible COVID-19 infection

**SOAP Note:**

**Subjective:**
The patient presents with a one-week history of a stuffy nose that has progressed to a runny nose. The nasal discharge is mainly clear, with no cough, sore throat, shortness of breath, fevers, or chills reported. The symptoms have been constant over the past week, with a slight improvement noted after using decongestants. The patient reports mild fatigue but denies any loss of taste or smell, chest pain, gastrointestinal symptoms, or urinary difficulties. There is a history of type 1 diabetes diagnosed in childhood, for which the patient is compliant with insulin therapy. No recent sick contacts or travel history reported.

**Objective:**
- Vital signs within normal limits
- Nasal congestion and clear nasal discharge noted
- Patient appears fatigued but otherwise well
- No signs of respiratory distress or other acute concerns

**Assessment:**
1. Viral upper respiratory infection, likely common cold, given the patient's symptoms of nasal congestion and clear discharge.
2. COVID-19 cannot be ruled out due to the ongoing pandemic, prompting the need for testing.

**Plan:**
1. Conduct a COVID-19 swab test to rule out infection; results expected in 48 hours.
2. Recommend supportive care including rest, hydration, and over-the-counter medications like Tylenol cold for symptom relief.
3. Advise the patient to isolate at home until test results are available and follow public health guidelines accordingly.
4. Follow up with the patient post-test results to provide further instructions or treatment as necessary.
5. Monitor for any worsening symptoms or development of new concerns.
