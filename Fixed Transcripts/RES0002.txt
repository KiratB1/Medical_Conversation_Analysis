D: OK. And. So um it's sounding like, I wanted to do a work up for His symptoms right now for breathing heavily and with the fever that's concerning for a type of infection and with being under three months it would warrant some investigations. So we'd want to check, do some blood tests. Yeah, and check his cerebrospinal fluid as well to make sure that there's no infection um in the brain I guess and what kind of go go from there?

P: Sure, yeah, that sounds good.

D: OK, um in the meantime, yeah, we'll give him some inhalers and keep the oxygen on to help with the lungs and breathing and then keep monitoring for how he's doing symptomatically.

P: OK, thank you.
